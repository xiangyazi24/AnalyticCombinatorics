# DOCTRINE — Path A: discharge the two Doeblin walls from scratch (unconditional Hardy–Ramanujan)

## Goal (one sentence)
Prove `∀ᶠ J, DoeblinWalls J` with zero axioms, turning `erdos_partition_limit_exists_of_walls`
into the UNCONDITIONAL `erdos_partition_limit_exists : ∃ a > 0, Tendsto u atTop (𝓝 a)`.

## Mathematical structure (what the walls really are)
Both walls concern the L-step law of the killed Erdős predecessor chain. The per-step rank-decrement
Δ = rnk(n) − rnk(n−m), m ~ erdosWeight, has (in the continuous Γ(2,C) limit, banked as
`Model.modelIntegral` / `erdos_kernel_window`):
  • jump m = x√n  ⟹  Δ ≈ 3x/2,  with x distributed ∝ (π²/6) x e^{−Cx/2}  (the Γ(2,C/2) shape);
  • E[Δ] = Θ(1) (constant, R-independent); the chain takes ~ R/E[Δ] ~ Θ(R) steps to drop from rank R
    to the boundary J  ⟹  Θ(R) regenerations  ⟹  osc(h) at rank R ~ (1−δ)^{cR} → 0. This Θ(R)-fold
    geometric decay IS the convergence (renewal mechanism).

## KEY SUBTLETY found while drafting (affects avenue choice — needs your eyes)
The banked capstone `tendsto_of_killed_doeblin` uses the ESCAPE-SPLIT engine: overlap δ on band
{rnk ≥ R−B} (fixed B) + escape mass `e(R) → 0`, via `tendsto_zero_of_step_contraction`. But the
per-step big-jump probability is  P(Δ > B) ~ e^{−cB},  CONSTANT in R (it is a normalized tail, no R).
So with FIXED B the escape mass does NOT → 0; it is a small constant ε(B). The escape-split recursion
then gives  V(R) ≤ (1−δ)V(R−B) + ε·2M  ⟹  V(∞) ≤ ε·2M/δ  (small constant, NOT 0). I.e. WALL 2 as
currently stated (`e(R)→0`, fixed B) is NOT satisfiable for this kernel. The honest convergence needs
the Θ(R)-fold geometric decay (growing block count), which the constant-B additive engine cannot give.

GOOD NEWS: the alternative engine is ALSO already banked — `tailsup_summable` (TailSup.lean):
  W R ≤ q · sSup(W '' {s ≥ R−B})  ⟹  Summable (sSup over tails)  ⟹  convergence,
PURE multiplicative (no additive e(R)). It captures the Θ(R)-fold decay directly. The remaining
difficulty is the big-jump mass: it lands at rank < R−B where osc is LARGER (V antitone), so it is not
automatically ≤ q·V(R−B). It must be handled by overlapping the big-jump landing laws too, or by a
coupling that couples big jumps.

## Avenues (ranked)
(a) RE-WIRE to the tail-sup engine + full-support overlap. Prove the L-step laws from i,j (rank ≥ R)
    overlap by δ on the WHOLE support {rnk ≥ J}, AND that the non-overlap (1−δ) part, after differencing,
    sees osc ≤ q·sSup(W over {s ≥ R−B}). Feed `tailsup_summable` (banked). Terminal: Summable tail-osc
    ⟹ `tendsto_of_center_tracking` (banked) ⟹ converge. Most reuse of banked infra.
(b) COUPLING. Construct a coupling of the two killed chains from i,j that meets within Θ(1) regenerations
    w.p. ≥ δ (maximal coupling per step using the single-step window minorization), handling big jumps by
    coupling them maximally too. Meeting ⟹ overlap. Cleanest probabilistically, heaviest in Lean (no
    Mathlib coupling-for-Markov-kernel machinery — would build it).
(c) DENSITY / LOCAL LIMIT. Transfer the Γ(2,C/2) lower density bound (banked window-integral convergence)
    to a discrete L-fold-convolution lower bound on the band ⟹ minorization δ. Needs arithmetic
    local-limit handling of the σ(m) factor (irregular) — hardest analytically.
(d) ESCAPE wall standalone (tractable warm-up regardless of route): per-step large-drop tail
    P(Δ > b) ≤ C e^{−cb} uniform in R, from the erdosWeight formula + sigmaR bounds + the
    √n−√(n−m) ≥ b/3 exponential. This is needed by (a)/(b) as the big-jump control.

## Terminal conditions
- Success: `erdos_partition_limit_exists` unconditional, audit GATE_EXIT_0, clean-3, 0 sorry.
- Avenue death: a written counterexample/obstruction (like the escape-constant finding above), then
  backtrack to the next avenue.

## Plan of attack
Start with (d) (escape per-step tail — concrete, needed everywhere), in parallel re-design the engine
wiring toward (a) (tail-sup + full-support overlap). Keep (b)/(c) as fallbacks. The escape-constant
finding means the FINAL connection (`tendsto_of_killed_doeblin` / `DoeblinWalls`) will likely be
re-stated against `tailsup_summable` rather than the escape-split — a framework revision, flagged here
because it touches banked code.

## UPDATE (resolution of the escape-constant subtlety — multi-scale engine)
The escape-constant problem is resolved WITHOUT a growing-step recursion, by a multi-scale limit:
  • for each fixed band width B: `V(R) ≤ (1−δ_B)·V(R−B) + δ_B·bnd B` (R ≥ R₀(B)), where
    `bnd B = 3·ε_B·M/δ_B` and ε_B = escape mass below band B for the L_B-step kernel;
  • `limsup_le_of_step_contraction_const` (banked) ⟹ `limsup V ≤ bnd B`;
  • this holds for EVERY B, and `bnd B → 0` (ε_B = e^{−cB} → 0, δ_B ≥ δ₀ > 0 since L_B ~ B steps
    over-mix the band) ⟹ `tendsto_zero_of_limsup_le_all` (banked) ⟹ `V → 0` ⟹ h converges.
Engine banked in StepContractionConst.lean; the multi-scale capstone in RenewalMultiB.lean
(`tendsto_of_tailOsc_multiB`, `tendsto_of_killed_doeblin_multiB`), reusing `doeblin_escape_bound`
unchanged. The two analytic walls are now correctly B-indexed:
  WALL 1':  ∀ B, overlap δ_B > 0 on band {rnk ≥ R−B} for the L_B-step killed kernel (δ_B ≥ δ₀);
  WALL 2':  ∀ B, escape mass below band B ≤ ε_B, with 3·ε_B·M/δ_B → 0  (ε_B → 0 fast).
This is the genuine renewal structure (Θ(R)-fold geometric mixing) in a form the banked engine drives.

## CORRECTION (Opus, honest) — the all-pairs overlap is FALSE; the real wall is V→0 (renewal)
Pressure-testing the wall against the kernel: `DoeblinWalls`/`DoeblinWallsMultiB` quantify the overlap
over ALL i,j with rnk ≥ R. For a far-apart pair (rnk i = R, rnk j = R+G, G large) the L-step laws
concentrate at ranks ≈ R−O(L) and ≈ R+G−O(L), DISJOINT, so ∑min = 0 < δ. The overlap conjunct is
unsatisfiable ⟹ bricks 66/69/71/72 are true implications but conditional on a FALSE premise; they do
NOT reduce HR to true facts. (Earlier "reduced to two satisfiable walls" was wrong.)

What's sound: every abstract engine (doeblin_escape_bound, doeblin_average_diff_bound, pair_contract,
tailsup_summable, tendsto_of_center_tracking, StepContraction(+Const), killed_harmonic_pow,
KilledStochastic, tendsto_of_tail_osc_to_zero, the multi-scale fix). The ERROR is the capstone
*structure*: overlap must be COMPARABLE-rank only (pair_contract), with far pairs handled by the
band/center structure.

Reduction to the true core: with c R := tailInf (monotone bounded ⟹ links summable for free) and
V R := tailOsc, `tendsto_of_center_tracking` (and equally `tendsto_of_tail_osc_to_zero`) reduce
h-convergence to **V R → 0** (tail oscillation → 0). And V is antitone-bounded so V R → V_∞ ≥ 0; the
whole difficulty is **V_∞ = 0**. The naive bounds give only factor 1:
  • averaging+escape: V R ≤ (1−ε)V(R−B) + 2εM  (ε = escape; factor ≈ 1, useless);
  • far-pair: the δ-overlap contraction only applies to comparable ranks; the sup-achiever and
    inf-achiever of the tail can sit at far-apart ranks, where overlap = 0.
So V_∞ = 0 is the genuine renewal/tail-triviality result for the rank-descending σ-kernel — the real
hard analytic wall. Routes: (i) standard renewal/coupling (couple the chains, meeting time finite a.s.);
(ii) tail-triviality of the descending chain; (iii) a quantitative mixing/spectral-gap argument.
DISPATCHED to ChatGPT for the cleanest Lean-formalizable argument. Escape estimate (input (B)) is being
ground in parallel (uniform exp-moment ∑ Pker(i,k)e^{s(rnk i−rnk k)} ≤ M for s < C/3, then Markov).

## FIND (Opus) — escape wall is essentially banked: far_erdos_tail_le
`far_erdos_tail_le` (MassRateApprox2): ∑_{m ∈ Icc (⌊n^{2/3}⌋+1) (n−1)} erdosWeight n m ≤ K/n eventually.
This is the big-jump mass (jump m > n^{2/3} ⟺ rank drop ≳ n^{1/6} ~ R^{1/3}), bounded by K/n → 0. Over
kernelMass → 1, the per-step P(rank drop > ~R^{1/3}) ≤ K'/n ~ K'·9/R². Union bound over the ~R-step
descent: P(any big jump) ≲ R/n → 0 ⟹ w.h.p. the chain makes NO big jump and descends by ≤ R^{1/3}/step.
So escape (input B) is in hand (modulo wiring far_erdos_tail_le into the band structure; note its natural
band ~R^{1/3} GROWS with R, so the contraction engine wants the growing-band/tail-sup variant, not fixed
B). The ONLY genuine wall left is the OVERLAP / renewal convergence V→0 (comparable-rank Doeblin →
far-pair convergence) — dispatched to ChatGPT. model_tail_le + erdosWeight_sub_model_le give the
model-vs-kernel control likely needed for the comparable-rank overlap too.

## RESOLUTION (Opus + ChatGPT R2) — correct capstone banked; lone wall = ErdosAlignment
ChatGPT R2 confirmed the all-pairs overlap is unprovable (matches my finding) and gave the correct
deterministic input: the m-step terminal-law ALIGNMENT  ov(P̃^m(i,·),P̃^m(j,·)) ≥ 1−(1−δ)^m−ε (high
starts). Then |h i−h j| = |μ_i h − μ_j h| ≤ 2M(1−ov) ≤ 2M((1−δ)^m+ε) ⟹ V∞=0. BANKED clean-3:
  brick 73 RenewalAlign.tendsto_of_renewal_alignment (the capstone, full-support overlap + squeeze);
  brick 74 ErdosAlignConnect.erdos_partition_limit_exists_of_alignment (reduces HR to ErdosAlignment).
This SUPERSEDES the conditional-on-false bricks 66/69/71/72 (kept as valid-but-vacuous infra).

### Lone remaining wall: ErdosAlignment J  (the m-step terminal-law overlap)
Decomposes into:
  (B′) comparable-rank single-step overlap δ* > 0: for rnk i = rnk j (≥ R₁),
       ∑_k min(Pker i k, Pker j k) ≥ δ*  — kernel L¹-continuity in the start index; provable from banked
       erdosWeight_sub_model_le + model_tail_le + kernelMass→1.
  (ITER) descent-coupling: single-step comparable overlap ⟹ m-step terminal overlap ≥ 1−(1−δ*)^m, via
       the two chains synchronizing at the shared lower rank levels they both descend through. THE hard
       analytic core (needs a coupling/overlap-iteration; Mathlib has no Markov coupling). Escape (no big
       jumps, far_erdos_tail_le) feeds both. Dispatched R3 to ChatGPT for the explicit ITER argument.

## CORRECTION 2 (Opus + ChatGPT R3) — bricks 73/74 alignment also unsatisfiable; correct = windowed ITER
ChatGPT R3 §0: the clean alignment ov(P̃^m(i,·),P̃^m(j,·)) ≥ 1−(1−δ)^m−ε for arbitrary far ranks is
FALSE (counterexample: deterministic descent, rank gap > m ⟹ disjoint m-step laws ⟹ overlap 0). So
bricks 73/74's `halign` hypothesis is unsatisfiable for far pairs — a SECOND conditional-on-false capstone.
They stay as valid-but-vacuous infra; the correct reduction needs the windowed deterministic ITER.

### Correct structure (ChatGPT R3, saved verbatim in HANDOFF/chatgpt-R3-iter-design.md)
NO probabilistic coupling — pure finite-sum algebra over the reachable Finset:
  • (B_W) windowed minorization: |rnk x − rnk y| ≤ W ⟹ ∑_z min(P x z, P y z) ≥ δ. (provable from
    (B′) exact-rank overlap + local-TV regularity: ov(μ,ν') ≥ ov(μ,ν) − ‖ν−ν'‖₁.)
  • deterministic coupling pair (ρ_t, U_t): ρ_t = coalesced common-minorant mass, U_t(x,y) = unmatched
    pair mass. C_{x,y}(z) = if Good_W x y then min(Px z, Py z) else 0; Lres = Px − C, Rres = Py − C;
    Kres(x,y;a,b) = Lres·Rres/(1−cmass) residual product.
  • MARGINAL INVARIANT (crux mechanical lemma, induction on t):
      ρ_t(z) + ∑_y U_t(z,y) = P^t(i,z);  ρ_t(z) + ∑_x U_t(x,z) = P^t(j,z).
    ⟹ ρ_t ≤ min(μ_t, ν_t) ⟹ ∑ρ_t ≤ overlap(μ_t,ν_t).
  • CORE INEQ: u_{t+1} = ∑ U_t(x,y)(1−cmass(x,y)) ≤ (1−δ)u_t + δ·b_t,  b_t = unmatched mass OUTSIDE
    the window. (cmass ≥ δ on good pairs.)
  • scalar_rec_solve (BUILT, ScalarRecSolve.lean, brick 75): u_m ≤ q^m u_0 + δ∑ q^{m−t−1} e_t.
  ⟹ iter_window_overlap: overlap(P^m(i,·),P^m(j,·)) ≥ 1 − (1−δ)^m − δ∑(1−δ)^{m−t−1} e_t.

### The LONE deep analytic wall (now precisely isolated): the bad-mass bound
  b_t = unmatched mass outside the rank window ≤ e_t  (with ∑_{t<m} b_t ≤ E small, the aggregate form is
  easier). This is the rank-difference walk ENTERING the window — a local-CLT / recurrence statement
  (A = no-big-jumps, banked, feeds it but does NOT prove it). ChatGPT R3 §7: keep layers separate
  (A + rank-decrement asymptotics ⟹ bad-mass; B_W ⟹ one-step coalescence; finite-sum ITER ⟹ m-step).

NEXT (mechanical, in progress): build the ITER (ρ_t,U_t marginal invariant + core ineq + iter_window_overlap)
over the reachable Finset, then the capstone tendsto_of_renewal_alignment' taking (B_W)+bad-mass.
Lone hard wall left after that: the bad-mass/recurrence local-CLT.

## MILESTONE (Opus) — bricks 75-76: the deterministic windowed-coupling ITER is DONE
ScalarRecSolve.scalar_rec_solve + ITERCoupling.iter_window_overlap banked clean-3. The entire renewal
ALIGNMENT is now mechanized as finite-sum algebra (~20 lemmas, no probabilistic coupling library):
  ρ_t (coalesced common minorant) + U_t (unmatched pair mass), marginal invariant
  ρ_t z + ∑_y U_t z y = P^t i z  (left_marginal/right_marginal, the crux induction) ⟹ ρ_t ≤ min(μ_t,ν_t)
  ⟹ ∑ρ_t ≤ overlap;  unmatched mass contracts  u_{t+1} ≤ (1−δ)u_t + δ·badMass_t  (umass_core)
  ⟹ iter_window_overlap:  overlap(P^m i, P^m j) ≥ 1 − (1−δ)^m − δ·∑(1−δ)^{m−t−1}·badMass_t.

### Remaining chain (precisely isolated)
(1) INSTANTIATION GLUE [mechanical]: apply the abstract ITER (over Fintype `Fin (N+1)`) to the concrete
    `killedKer Pker rnk J` — Mpow ↔ KPowK correspondence, killedKer stochastic on the reachable set,
    overlap correspondence.
(2) E-CORRECTED CAPSTONE [mechanical]: the banked `tendsto_of_renewal_alignment` takes the (false) clean
    alignment; replace with one consuming iter_window_overlap's E-corrected bound + the V→0 squeeze
    (forcing → 0 requires sup over high i,j of badMass-sum → 0).
(3) TWO ANALYTIC WALLS:
    (B_W) windowed minorization  δ ≤ cmass(x,y) for |rnk x − rnk y| ≤ W  — kernel L¹-continuity in the
        start index; provable from banked erdosWeight_sub_model_le + model_tail_le + kernelMass→1. [hard
        but mechanical-ish estimate]
    (BAD-MASS) badMass_t ≤ e_t with e_t → 0 appropriately — the rank-difference walk entering the rank
        window; a RECURRENCE / local-CLT statement. **THE lone irreducible analytic wall** (Mathlib has
        no local-CLT/recurrence for such walks; (A)=far_erdos_tail_le feeds it but does not prove it).

So HR is now reduced — on the mechanical side, essentially completely — to the single bad-mass/recurrence
fact (plus the L¹-continuity estimate). That recurrence is the genuine analytic frontier of path A.

## REFINED STRUCTURE (Opus) — center-tracking resolves far pairs; ITER is for COMPARABLE pairs only
The far-pair obstruction recurs at every "overlap-for-all-pairs" formulation (incl. the E-corrected one):
a far pair (rnk i = R, rnk j = R+G, G≫m) has overlap ≈ 0 at any fixed m, so V(R)=sup over ALL pairs
can't be squeezed by overlap. The CORRECT resolution uses the banked `tendsto_of_center_tracking`:
  • block centers c(R); block oscillation V_blk(R) = osc over COMPARABLE pairs (|rnk i − rnk j| ≤ W);
  • h converges if  V_blk → 0  AND  ∑_R |c(R+1) − c(R)| < ∞  (summable center links)  AND
    |h n − c(rnk n)| ≤ V_blk(rnk n)  (tracking).  [exactly the banked CenterTracking interface]
Far pairs are handled by  |h i − h j| ≤ V_blk(rnk i) + |c(rnk i) − c(rnk j)| + V_blk(rnk j), the middle
term ≤ tail of the summable links → 0.  The ITER overlap is then needed ONLY for COMPARABLE pairs
(|rnk i − rnk j| ≤ W) — which IS satisfiable (comparable starts are in the window, so badMass is small
and they align: overlap ≥ 1 − (1−δ)^m − small).

### So the corrected remaining build:
(C1) `tendsto_of_block_overlap` capstone: comparable-pair m-step overlap (≥ 1−(1−δ)^m − small) ⟹
     V_blk → 0 and summable links ⟹ via `tendsto_of_center_tracking` ⟹ h converges. [mechanical]
(C2) instantiate ITER for the killed kernel (Mpow ↔ KPowK) restricted to comparable pairs. [glue]
(C3) (B_W) windowed minorization δ ≤ cmass (L¹-continuity). [hard estimate, within reach]
(C4) comparable-pair bad-mass: for |rnk i − rnk j| ≤ W (≥ J), badMass_t → 0 as both chains descend to
     the absorbing boundary {rnk < J} (which lies entirely inside the window W ≥ J, so all boundary
     pairs are "good"). The RATE (geometric in R, for the summable links) is the analytic content —
     now about COMPARABLE-pair absorption, NOT the far-pair recurrence. Still analysis, but tractable.
The deep far-pair recurrence/local-CLT is AVOIDED by center-tracking. The lone analytic content is the
comparable-pair bad-mass decay (C4) + the L¹-continuity (C3). Both lean on the banked model machinery.

## HONEST REFINEMENT of C4 (Opus) — comparable bad-mass is still a coalescence/diff-walk statement
Earlier I framed C4 as "comparable pairs absorb into the window, so bad-mass → 0 — tractable." That is
too optimistic. For a same-rank pair (rnk i = rnk j, indices differ), the two coupled chains have a
rank-DIFFERENCE that starts at 0 but does a mean-0 random walk (difference of two ~Γ(2,C/2) decrements),
spreading like √t. The bad-mass b_t = unmatched mass with |rnk-difference| > W. So b_t can GROW in t
until coalescence. The ITER's scalar solve weights it by (1−δ)^{m−t−1} (downweighting old steps), so
what's needed is essentially: the unmatched mass coalesces (δ chance/step while in window) FASTER than
the diff-walk carries it out of the window. This is a genuine recurrence/coalescence estimate for the
rank-difference walk — NOT trivially "they absorb." Center-tracking removes the UNBOUNDED-gap far pairs
(good), but the residual comparable-pair bad-mass is still real analysis (local-CLT/recurrence flavor for
a bounded-start diff walk). It IS more tractable than the unbounded far-pair version (bounded initial
gap; the window W can be taken ≥ the typical √m spread by choosing m ~ W²), but it is NOT mechanical.

So the lone irreducible analytic content of path A is: (C3) Pker L¹-continuity in the start index +
(C4) the comparable-start rank-difference-walk coalescence/bad-mass bound. Both are genuine analysis
leaning on the σ-kernel asymptotics (banked model machinery); C4 is the harder, and how deeply to build
the coalescence/local-limit foundations is a scope decision. Everything mechanical (bricks 61-77) is done.

## HONEST FINAL FRAMING (Opus) — BOTH remaining walls are σ-averaging / arithmetic-local-limit analysis
Scoping modelSummand (= σ(m)·exp(−(massLam/√n)m)·(1/n + m/n² − …)) shows C3 is NOT a routine calculus
estimate. The kernel L¹ distance ∑_z|Pker x z − Pker y z| compares the two rows at SHIFTED jump indices
(m_x = x−z vs m_y = y−z, differing by x−y), so it hinges on σ(m) vs σ(m + (x−y)) summed — the σ(m)
ARITHMETIC IRREGULARITY is the core difficulty, the SAME σ-averaging / arithmetic-local-limit flavor as
C4 (the diff-walk coalescence). So:

  Both C3 (windowed minorization via L¹-continuity) and C4 (comparable bad-mass / coalescence) reduce to
  AVERAGED control of the σ-weighted kernel under index shifts — i.e. an arithmetic local-limit theorem
  for the σ(m)-weighted predecessor walk. This is the genuine irreducible analytic content of Erdős's
  elementary Hardy–Ramanujan proof, and Mathlib has NO σ-averaging / local-limit machinery for it.

### Net, fully honest, status of path A
HR (erdos_partition_limit_exists) is reduced — with the ENTIRE renewal/coupling/center-tracking machinery
mechanized clean-3 (bricks 61-78) — to a single class of fact: an arithmetic local-limit / σ-averaging
estimate for the Erdős kernel under index shifts (yielding both the windowed minorization δ and the
coalescence/bad-mass bound). Building that from scratch in Lean means constructing σ-average and
local-limit foundations Mathlib lacks — a major, multi-week+ undertaking whose SCOPE (how deep to build
those probability/number-theory foundations, vs. a different attack) is the senior author's decision.
The banked Model machinery (modelIntegral, erdos_kernel_window, erdosWeight_sub_model_le, far_erdos_tail_le,
kernelMass→1) is the starting capital, but the σ-shift averaging is the new content.
This is the genuine research frontier of path A — not a mechanical gap.

## BREAKTHROUGH (Opus, 06-08) — C3 minorization is ELEMENTARY via σ(m) ≥ m (no σ-averaging!)
ChatGPT (ask-gpt ac) correctly said: use BLOCK overlap not L¹, and the content is ∑_m min(σ(m),σ(m+d))
≥ cN. It worried a σ-free bound fails ("σ≥1 gives Θ(N^{-1/2})"). BUT it (and I earlier) missed:
σ(m) ≥ m (since m ∣ m ⟹ sigmaR m = ∑_{d|m} d ≥ m). In the window jump m ∈ [a√x, b√x] this gives
σ(m) ≥ a√x, and ∑ over ~(b−a)√x terms gives Θ(x) — the RIGHT order. So:

  ∑_k min(Pker x k, Pker y k)  ≥  (Θ(1)/x)·∑_{j∈[a√x,b√x]} min(σ(j), σ(j+(y−x)))
     ≥ (Θ(1)/x)·∑_j min(j, j+(y−x))  [σ≥self]  ≥ (Θ(1)/x)·(b−a)√x·(a−D)√x  = (b−a)(a−D)·Θ(1) = δ>0,

where |y−x| ≤ D√x (comparable, D=2W/3), window left endpoint a > D, smooth factor 1/k·exp(−C(√x−√k))/km
= Θ(1)/x on the window (k~x, exp∈[e^{−Cb/2},e^{−Ca/2}], km→1). FULLY ELEMENTARY: needs only σ(m)≥m,
σ(m)≤... not even needed, k~x, exp monotonicity, kernelMass→1 (banked). NO σ-summatory, NO local-limit,
NO concentration. This bypasses the σ-averaging wall I'd flagged. The minorization δ(W)>0 (decreasing in
W via e^{−CW}). C4 (bad-mass/diff-walk) still to assess, but C3 is cracked elementarily.
Formalizing in ErdosMinorization.lean: sigmaR_ge_self → block-min → smooth-factor → δ.

## C3 BANKED + C4 SHARPENED (Opus, 06-08) — bricks 79/80/81

- **Brick 79 `Pker_window_minor` (ErdosMinorization.lean), clean-3, gated.** δ = exp(−C(2+D))/8 > 0,
  UNIFORM for x ≥ 16 (rank ≥ 12). The σ-averaging wall is bypassed for C3. Done, on main.
- **Brick 80 `harmonic_diff_le_overlap` (HarmonicOverlap.lean), clean-3.** Route-independent half:
  bounded m-step-harmonic h ⟹ |h i − h j| ≤ 2B(1 − overlap(pᵢ,pⱼ)). Pure linear algebra.
- **Brick 81 `umass_le_one_sub_occupation` / `overlap_ge_occupation` (ITEROccupation.lean), clean-3.**
  Telescoping umass_core gives umass m ≤ 1 − δ·∑_{t<m} goodMass t (cumulative WINDOW OCCUPATION),
  hence overlap(Pᵐ i,Pᵐ j) ≥ δ·∑ goodMass t.

### The single remaining input (C4, sharpened to occupation form)
Single-window single-pass ITER is PROVABLY insufficient for C = π/√6 (self-consistency 2 ln v = c v,
c ≈ ⅔C ≈ 0.855 > 2/e ≈ 0.736 has no solution — derived by Opus, independently confirmed by ChatGPT R5).
The occupation form fixes this: it credits EVERY return of the rank-difference walk D_t = rnk Xₜ − rnk Yₜ
to the window, not just the first pass. So the ENTIRE wall is now ONE lemma:

  **(C4-occ)  ∑_{t<M} goodMass t  →  1/δ   (i.e. ≥ (1−ε)/δ for M = M(rank) large), as rank → ∞.**

goodMass t = unmatched-coupling mass currently inside the rank window at step t. This is the window
LOCAL TIME of the residual coupling. D_t is a bounded-increment, centered (same marginal law for
comparable ranks), positive-local-variance walk on a finite rank ladder; it is recurrent, so its window
local time over the ~rank(n) steps before absorption → ∞. ChatGPT R5 recommends a finite Lyapunov /
hitting argument for D_t (NOT Mathlib martingales/Azuma, which lack a usable API; NOT a Tauberian bypass,
judged longer). Plan: bound goodMass t below by (window-fraction)·umass t and the residual-walk return
structure; the genuine analytic content is the recurrence/return-count of D_t under the Erdős kernel
(uses banked far_erdos_tail_le for bounded increments + erdos_kernel_window for the local variance).
This is the lone open frontier; everything else (C3 + both convergence halves) is banked clean-3.

## FINAL REDUCTION (Opus, 06-08) — bricks 82/83, the wall is ONE probability lemma + instantiation

The occupation form is realized via a GREEN POTENTIAL (ChatGPT R6/R7, verified+formalized):
- **Brick 82 `occupation_ge_green_tight`:** for any Kres-Poisson-subsolution g, `g i j − greenMass M ≤ ∑ goodMass`.
- **Brick 83 `greenT_subsolution`:** the finite-horizon `greenT T = ∑_{t<T} KresAct^[t] goodIndic` IS a
  subsolution FOR FREE (Poisson identity `KresAct(greenT)=greenT−goodIndic+KresAct^[T]goodIndic`,
  nonneg tail). No recurrence needed for the subsolution — finite-sum algebra.

### The lone analytic input (now exactly pinned)
  **greenT T (i,j) ≥ (1−ε)/δ for high-rank comparable starts** — equivalently the EXPECTED LOCAL TIME
  `∑_{t<T} P(|D_t| ≤ W) ≥ (1−ε)/δ`. A mean-0, bounded-increment, local-variance-v walk has
  `P(|D_t|≤W) ≳ W/√t` (local-CLT lower bound), so `∑_{t<T} ≳ W√T`; with T up to the absorption time
  ~ rnk(i) → ∞, `W√T ≥ 1/δ = e^{cW}` once `rnk(i) ≥ e^{2cW}/W²` (constant, W fixed). Chebyshev ALONE gives
  only ~W² ≪ 1/δ — the √T (multi-excursion recurrence) is irreducible. The genuine content is the
  local-CLT/recurrence LOWER bound `P(|D_t|≤W) ≳ 1/√t` (equivalently `∑_t P(D_t=0)=∞`), which Mathlib
  lacks a ready form of. Per-step moments feeding it (banked): erdos_kernel_window (local variance v>0),
  far_erdos_tail_le (bounded increments), kernelMass→1. THIS is the method-flexibility point.

### Remaining instantiation (mechanical-ish)
Instantiate the abstract ITER (α=Fin(N+1), P=killed Pker, rnk) for `hhit` in ErdosLimit's
`erdos_partition_limit_exists_of_hit`. Subtlety: Pker_window_minor gives δ only for rank ≥ 12, so the
occupation predicate generalizes from GoodW to `Good ⊆ GoodW` (minorizable high-rank window); bricks
81/82/83 generalize cleanly (proofs never used GoodW's specific form). Then harmonic_diff_le_overlap (80)
+ overlap→1 ⟹ hitVal converges.

Banked clean-3 this campaign night: 79 (δ minorization), 80 (harmonic bridge), 81 (occupation),
82 (Green telescoping), 83 (greenT subsolution-for-free). HR fully architected; only non-mechanical
gap is the local-time/recurrence lower bound.

## DETERMINISTIC TANAKA OCCUPATION MACHINERY BANKED (Opus, 06-08), bricks 84–90
The local-time lower bound (occupation → ∞) is now built in the deterministic finite-sum substrate
(NO measure theory, NO local-CLT), via Tanaka + Paley–Zygmund:
- 84 mean_sq_cubed_le: (∑pf²)³ ≤ (∑p|f|)²(∑pf⁴)  [Paley–Zygmund anti-concentration].
- 85 abs_drift_nonneg/le/eq_of_far: per-step |D|-submartingale drift, compensator = window local time.
- 86 occupation_ge_tanaka: window-occ ≥ (E|D_T| − E|D_0|)/b  [telescoped over distPow].
- 87 sq_moment_telescope/sq_moment_ge: Doob for D², lower QV E[D_T²] ≥ E0²+v₀T.
- 88 fourth_drift_le: per-step 4th-moment drift ≤ 8b²Dx²+3b⁴.
- 89 sq_moment_le + fourth_moment_telescope_le: upper QV + 4th-moment telescoping.
- 90 locVar_le + fourth_moment_le_quadratic: E[D_T⁴] ≤ E0⁴+8b²E0²T+8b⁴T²+3b⁴T (quadratic).
Combine: (E|D_T|)²·CT² ≥ (E[D_T²])³ ≥ (v₀T)³ ⟹ E|D_T| ≥ c√T (capstone, next) ⟹ occupation → ∞ > 1/δ.

### ⚠ Instantiation subtlety: D is only an APPROXIMATE martingale for Pker
D = rnk X − rnk Y under the product walk has E[D'] − D = −(μ(rnk X) − μ(rnk Y)) where μ(r) = mean
rank-decrement at rank r. For the Erdős kernel μ(r) ≈ 3/2 (rank-independent to leading order) but the
rank-DEPENDENCE gives |E[D'] − D| ≤ η with η ~ 1/√n → 0 (NOT exactly 0). So the exact-martingale bricks
84–90 do not instantiate verbatim. Options: (a) η-robust versions (QV/Tanaka identities pick up error
terms ≤ 2η·∑E|D_t|; manageable since η·T_coalesce ~ 1/√n → 0 ≪ W for high rank — matches convergence
as rank→∞); (b) scale-function transform φ (harmonic for Pker, so φ(X)−φ(Y) is an EXACT martingale) —
needs φ regularity for the increment/variance bounds. A drift HURTS occupation (chains drift apart, no
return), so η must be threaded as → 0 with rank; this is precisely why HR convergence is a rank→∞ statement.
The exact-martingale machinery is the rank→∞ backbone; the η→0 control is the bridge to discharge next.

## ABSTRACT + η-ROBUST OCCUPATION BACKBONE COMPLETE (Opus, 06-08), bricks 79–94
The entire recurrence/occupation content (the conceptual wall that needed local-CLT/martingale machinery)
is mechanized clean-3 in elementary deterministic form, INCLUDING η-robustness for the approximate-
martingale Erdős kernel. occupation_unbounded_eta (brick 94): for an η-approx-martingale, bounded-
increment-b, locVar≥v₀, |D|≤R walk with 0<v₀−2Rη, the window occupation exceeds any target. Trivial
E[D_T⁴]≤R⁴ + linear lower QV ⟹ PZ gives (E|D_T|)²≥((v₀−2Rη)T)³/R⁴→∞.

### CONCRETE Pker INSTANTIATION ROADMAP (the remaining phase)
Infrastructure (all over ℕ; for fixed i,j the killed chain lives on {0..max(i,j)}, effectively finite):
- killedKer P rnk J (KilledHarmonic.lean): identity-absorb below J, Pker above.
- hitVal P rnk J u (RenewalHitPot.lean): harmonic extension; hitVal_eq the 1-step relation;
  killed_harmonic_pow: hitVal is harmonic for every KPowK L (killedKer) — the m-step killed law.
- Goal hhit: ∀ᶠ J, ∃ L, Tendsto (hitVal Pker rnk J u) atTop (𝓝 L).
Steps:
1. Finite-state setup: restrict to Fin(N+1) (N ≥ max start); killedKer stochastic (check Pker_mass:
   ∑_{range n} Pker = 1 above J; identity row below). hKsum/hKnn for the abstract machinery.
2. Concrete per-step Erdős moments (the genuine analytic inputs): mean rank-decrement μ(r) and the
   approx-martingale bound |E[ΔD]| ≤ η(r) ~ 1/r² for comparable pairs (from the jump law / erdos_kernel_
   window); local variance v₀ > 0 (erdos_kernel_window gives the Θ(1) rank-step variance); bounded
   increment b (far_erdos_tail_le).
   ⚠ USE THE UNROUNDED SCALE (Opus 06-08): rnk = ⌊3√n⌋, and the ROUNDED difference D = ⌊3√X⌋−⌊3√Y⌋ has a
   Θ(1) floor perturbation (frac(3√X)−frac(3√Y) is Θ(1) for comparable X,Y) — it is NOT an approximate
   martingale. FIX: take the martingale coordinate to be the UNROUNDED D̃ = 3√X − 3√Y. Then
   μ̃(n) = 3√n − 3·E[√(n−m)] = μ̄ + c/√n + O(1/n) (smooth; expand √(1−m/n), μ̄ = (3/2)E[y], c = (3/8)E[y²],
   y = m/√n under the model density f(y) = (π²/6)y e^{−Cy/2}), so η̃ = |μ̃(X)−μ̃(Y)| ~ |c|·W·r/n^{3/2} ~ 1/r²
   (since n ~ r²). The window |D̃| ≤ b relates to the rnk-window |rnk X − rnk Y| ≤ W within O(1) slack
   (|D̃ − D| < 1), so the occupation/minorization transfer with an O(1) window adjustment. This avoids the
   floor being fatal. The concrete computation: expand μ̃ via the decrement moments E[y], E[y²] from
   erdos_kernel_window (Gamma integrals of f), and bound η̃ via the c/√n correction's rank-derivative.
3. ⚠ PRODUCT→COALESCING BRIDGE (the key remaining analytical piece, mechanism worked out):
   occupation_unbounded_eta is for a STOCHASTIC (mass-conserving) walk, but Umat is SUBSTOCHASTIC. Use the
   CONDITIONED walk Ûmat(t) := Umat(t)/umass(t) (= Umat conditioned on not-yet-coalesced). Ûmat is
   stochastic and evolves by the renormalized kernel K̂res(x,y,·) := Kres/(1−cmass) = Lres⊗Rres/(1−cmass)²
   (∑ K̂res = 1). Apply occupation_unbounded_eta to (K̂res, D=rnk-diff, Ûmat₀=δ_{(i,j)}) ⟹ the conditioned
   window occupation ∑ĝoodMass(t) → ∞. Bridge to umass: goodMass(t) = umass(t)·ĝoodMass(t) (un-normalized
   = mass × conditioned fraction). Brick 81 gives δ·∑_{t<M} goodMass ≤ 1 (umass ≥ 0). Contradiction: if
   umass(t) ≥ ε for all t ≤ M then ∑goodMass ≥ ε·∑ĝoodMass → ∞, impossible. Hence umass(M) < ε for M
   large; umass nonincreasing ⟹ umass → 0. The K̂res moments: OFF-window K̂res = Kprod = P⊗P exactly
   (cmass=0 there), so mart-eta/v₀/b come from the product Erdős kernel; ON-window K̂res reweights the
   residual but the rank-diff increments stay ≤ b. THIS is the lemma to build (the conditioned-walk
   occupation + the ε-contradiction), then it consumes occupation_unbounded_eta directly.
4. Assembly: umass→0 ⟹ overlap(KPowK L i,KPowK L j)→1 (overlap_ge_occupation 81 / umass_eq) ⟹
   |hitVal i − hitVal j|→0 (harmonic_diff_le_overlap 80, hitVal bounded by u's bounds) for comparable i,j
   ⟹ (center-tracking CompContraction 77, far pairs via summable links) hitVal converges ⟹ hhit ⟹
   erdos_partition_limit_exists_of_hit. No conceptual wall; concrete-kernel analysis + the bridge.

## ABSTRACT OCCUPATION BACKBONE COMPLETE + η-robustness QUANTITATIVELY SOUND (Opus, 06-08), brick 91
occupation_unbounded (brick 91) closes the abstract chain: for a mean-preserving, bounded-increment (b),
uniformly-positive-local-variance (v₀) walk, the cumulative window occupation exceeds ANY target (hence
1/δ). The entire abstract recurrence content is now mechanized clean-3 in elementary deterministic form
(bricks 79–91), no measure theory, no local-CLT.

### η is small: the η-robust instantiation is feasible (KEY quantitative finding)
The drift η = |E[D'] − D| = |μ(rnk X) − μ(rnk Y)| where μ(r) = mean rank-decrement at rank r. For the
Erdős kernel μ(r) → 3/2 with a ~1/r correction, so μ'(r) ~ 1/r², and for comparable X,Y (|rnk-diff| ≤ W
= O(1)) η ~ |μ'(r)|·W ~ 1/r² (≈ 1/n, NOT 1/√n). Effect on the occupation chain:
- η-robust Tanaka (brick 86'): occ ≥ (E|D_T| − E|D_0| − η·T)/b  [off-window |D|-drift is ≤ η, not 0].
- η-robust QV (brick 87'): E[D_T²] ≥ E0² + v₀T − 2η·∑E|D_t| ≥ v₀T − 2ηTR; with η ~ 1/r², R ~ r,
  the correction 2ηTR ~ 2T/r ≪ v₀T at the optimal T ~ r². So lower QV survives.
- Optimal horizon: occ ≥ (c√T − ηT − W0)/b maximized at T ~ c²r²/4 gives occ ~ c²r/4 → ∞ ≫ 1/δ.
So the η-drift is negligible relative to the variance signal; the approach is sound. This is precisely
why HR convergence is a rank→∞ statement (η → 0 only as rank → ∞).

### Remaining concrete phase (η-robust re-derivation + Pker instantiation)
1. η-robust versions of bricks 85–91 (per-step |D|-drift and QV pick up ≤ η error terms; 4th-moment
   binomial's mean-zero term becomes ≤ η; PZ brick 84 needs NO change). Each mirrors the exact version
   with a tracked η. Moderate, mechanical re-derivation.
2. Concrete per-step Pker moments: mean rank-decrement μ(r) and |μ(X)−μ(Y)| ≤ η(r) ~ 1/r² (from
   erdos_kernel_window / the jump law), local variance v₀ > 0 (from erdos_kernel_window), bounded
   increment b (from far_erdos_tail_le).
3. ITER instantiation: α = Fin(N+1), P = killed Pker, rnk; Good ⊆ GoodW = minorizable high-rank window;
   δ from Pker_window_minor; combine occupation_unbounded(η-robust) + overlap_ge_occupation (81) +
   harmonic_diff_le_overlap (80) ⟹ hitVal converges ⟹ erdos_partition_limit_exists_of_hit. No conceptual
   wall remains — concrete-kernel analysis + assembly.

## OCCUPATION LOWER BOUND: tent FAILS, Tanaka route VIABLE (Opus, 06-08, verified)

ChatGPT R8 proposed an explicit "tent" subsolution g = max(R−|D|,0)/b to make the lower bound elementary
(no local-CLT). VERIFIED FLAWED ("不盲信"): on-window Kres is SUB-stochastic (∑Kres = 1−cmass ≤ 1−δ;
coalescence removes exactly the high-potential mass near the tent peak), so ∑Kres·g ≥ (1−cmass)(g−1),
which is < g−1 whenever g > 1. The start (i,j) is on-window (comparable) and needs g(i,j) ≈ 1/δ ≫ 1, so
the tent cannot be a subsolution there. By LP duality the occupation potential greenT IS the maximal
subsolution, so NO elementary subsolution exceeds it — the recurrence content is irreducible. (ChatGPT
silently assumed ∑Kres = 1.)

VIABLE route (Tanaka + Paley–Zygmund, uses Mathlib's EXISTING martingale/Doob theory, NOT local-CLT):
  (1) lower quadratic variation: E[D_T²] ≥ v₀·(active steps) ≥ v₀·cT  (erdos local variance, banked-ish);
  (2) 4th-moment / BDG: E[D_T⁴] ≤ C·(v·T)²  (bounded increments far_erdos_tail_le);
  (3) Paley–Zygmund on D_T²: P(D_T² ≥ ½v₀T) ≥ c, hence E|D_T| ≥ c√T;
  (4) Doob/Tanaka: |D_t| − A_t is a martingale, compensator A_t = window local time (supported on
      |D_t| ≤ b, increment ≤ b), so E|D_T| = E[A_T] ≤ b·E[∑ 1_{|D_t|≤b}];
  (5) ⟹ window occupation E[∑_{t<T} 1_{|D_t|≤W}] ≥ E[A_T]/b ≥ c√T/b ≥ 1/δ once T ≥ b²/(c²δ²) (a
      constant; available since T ~ rnk(i) → ∞).
The genuine per-step analytic inputs (concrete Pker-kernel facts, bankable): mean-zero-off-window
E[ΔD]=0 (rank-step mean rank-independent), lower local variance v₀>0, bounded increment b, 4th-moment.
This is substantial but Mathlib-supported (martingale Doob decomposition exists). NEXT: build the per-step
moment lemmas + the Tanaka local-time bound, then the ITER instantiation (Good⊆GoodW generalization).

ARCHITECTURE DECISION (Opus, 06-08): do the Tanaka route in the DETERMINISTIC finite-sum substrate
(mirroring ITER/greenT), NOT Mathlib's measure-theoretic martingales. Define the product-walk
distribution M_prod(t) (both coords independent Pker steps, a prob dist on pairs, like Mpow);
then E[f(D_t)] := ∑_{x,y} M_prod(t)(x,y)·f(rnk x − rnk y), and all moments / the Doob compensator /
Paley–Zygmund become finite-sum identities (∑M_prod(t+1)|D| − ∑M_prod(t)|D| = ∑M_prod(t)·(one-step |D|
drift); the increasing compensator = window local time). Mathlib's predictablePart exists but bridging
deterministic-Umat ↔ measure-theoretic E[·] is avoidable and not worth the setup. Keep it finite-sum.

## KILLED-CHAIN INSTANTIATION: the ONE remaining analytic lemma (Opus + ChatGPT R11/R12, 06-08)
Abstract coupling machinery COMPLETE, 20 bricks (79-98): C3 minorization, harmonic→overlap bridge,
Green/occupation reduction, full Tanaka+Paley-Zygmund occupation (84-94), CoalesceBridge (95), smooth-scale
window transfer (96), D²-energy bridge (97), umass_tendsto_zero (98).

CRUX resolved (R12): applying coalescence to the KILLED chain (absorption ~r steps) needs L(i,j) =
P(no coalescence before both absorb) → 0 as start rank r → ∞. The D²-ENERGY route (97-98) has the WRONG
RATE (E ≤ R² loses the √r local-time scale; gives umass(r) ~ O(1), not → 0). The OCCUPATION route is
correct but occupation_unbounded_eta must be LOCALIZED: hypotheses needed only OFF the (high-rank) window
GoodHi (martingale |∑Khat·ΔD| ≤ η and variance ∑Khat·ΔD² ≥ v₀ off GoodHi; on-window arbitrary bounded —
the repelling drift is HARMLESS, charged to the occupation being lower-bounded), over the ACTIVE-PHASE
horizon M ~ r. The conditioned residual walk K̂res = Lres⊗Rres/(1−cmass)² is mart-eta OFF window
(=product there) which is all the localized lemma needs.

### THE single genuine analytic input (everything else is banked finite-sum):
  khat_residual_active_good_occupation_tends_infty:
    ∀ A>0, ∃ R0 M, ∀ comparable high-rank i,j (rnk ≥ R0, |ρi−ρj| ≤ W0),
      A ≤ ∑_{t<M} ∑_z K̂resᵗ(i,j)(z) · 1_{GoodHi z}
  (GoodHi z = Jhi ≤ rnk z.1 ∧ Jhi ≤ rnk z.2 ∧ |ρ z.1 − ρ z.2| ≤ Wρ, Jhi ≥ 16).
  = a 1-D recurrent bounded-increment walk, martingale+positive-variance OFF a fixed window, has expected
  window-visits before the rank clock descends r→Jhi tending to ∞ (the √r local time over the r-step
  descent). This is THE last probability lemma; it needs the concrete Erdős moments (off-window product
  drift η~1/r² [smooth ρ, μ̃ expansion], off-window variance v₀>0, bounded increment b, active-time→∞).
Then CoalesceBridge (95, with g = ĝ = goodMass/umass) gives umass M ≤ ε, hence overlap→1, hence
|hitVal i − hitVal j| → 0 (harmonic_diff_le_overlap 80), hence hitVal converges (center-tracking 77) ⟹ hhit.
Remaining FINITE-SUM (re-derivations/assembly): localized occupation lemma (generalize 92-94 to
off-window-only hyps + active horizon), GoodHi generalization of umass_core/brick 81, the final
killed_umass bridge, and the finite-state Fin(N+1) glue connecting KPowK/hitVal to the abstract Mpow/overlap.

## CONCRETE MOMENTS: smooth-scale resolution CONFIRMED + constants (Opus + ChatGPT R9, 06-08)
ChatGPT R9 independently confirmed the floor concern and the fix:
- Floored rnk=⌊3√n⌋ is NOT an approx-martingale coordinate: μ_floor(n) has an O(1) phase term F({3√n});
  comparable x,y differ in fractional phase by O(1), so |μ_floor(x)−μ_floor(y)| = Θ(1), NOT o(1/r). Fatal.
- FIX: martingale/tent coordinate = SMOOTH ρ(n) = 3√n (use Real.sqrt directly, no floor). Keep ⌊3√n⌋
  only for killing/window bookkeeping; transfer with constant slack |⌊ρx⌋−⌊ρy⌋|≤W ⟹ |ρx−ρy|≤W+2.
- For smooth ρ: μ_ρ(n) = E[ρ(n)−ρ(n−m)] = μ̄ + O(n^{−1/2}), and for comparable starts |x−y|=O(√n),
  |μ_ρ(x)−μ_ρ(y)| = O(n^{−1}) = O(r^{−2}). So η ~ 1/r² holds — but ONLY for smooth rank.
Constants (decrement y=m/√n ~ Gamma(2, λ=C/2), C=π/√6): μ̄ = 6√6/π; single-step smooth-rank variance
v = (9/4)Var(y) = 108/π²; product-difference walk v_D ≈ 2v = 216/π² > 0; increment b ~ (3/2)n^{1/6} on
m ≤ n^{2/3}. NORMALIZATION note: f(y)=(π²/6)y e^{−(C/2)y} integrates to 4 over (0,∞), not 1 — but moments
are normalization-independent ratios (∫yf/∫f), and actual Pker decrement = erdosWeight/kernelMass with
kernelMass→1 (banked), so use ratio moments. NEXT: formalize μ_ρ expansion (η~1/r²) + v_D>0 + b, set up
the smooth-ρ difference walk + K̂res, finite-state Fin(N+1), assemble to hhit. The floor showstopper is
RESOLVED; the route is sound.

## NO-BUILD WINDOW (server down 06-08): concrete η-rate scoped + bridge drafted (Opus + ChatGPT R13)
Server (uisai1) down; switched to draft-only (no build/commit of Lean) per Xiang. Verified-by-reading:
- R13's cited infra ALL EXISTS (grep-confirmed): modelSummand, sigmaMoment (= ∑' m^r σ(m) e^{−tm}),
  massLam=C/2 (massLam_sq: λ²=π²/6), sigmaMoment_le_power_sharp, erdosWeight_sub_model_le, main_range_error_le,
  sqrt_drop_second_order, exp_sqrt_drop_second_order, leftBlockMajorant (+summable). Plus sigmaMoment_zero/
  one/two_lambert and sigmaMoment_one/two_asymp_weak.
- KEY: the banked _asymp_weak give only the LEADING term with rate, e.g.
  |sigmaMoment 1 t − 2λ²/t³| ≤ 388/t²  (one term). R13 confirms μ̃ = μ̄ + O(1/√n) is INSUFFICIENT (gives
  2Rη ~ O(1), not < v₀). So the GENUINE remaining analytic input is the TWO-TERM Lambert expansions:
    sigmaMoment_one_two_term : |M₁ t − (2λ²/t³ − 1/(2t²))| ≤ K/t
    sigmaMoment_two_one_term : |M₂ t − 6λ²/t⁴| ≤ K/t³
    sigmaMoment_three_one_term : |M₃ t − 24λ²/t⁵| ≤ K/t⁴
  — extend the existing _asymp_weak proofs (boseReg/Lambert technique) by ONE order. THIS is the last hard
  analytic lemma (a Lambert/Bose-kernel moment expansion, NOT σ-local-averaging).
Route to μ̃ = μ̄ + μA/√n + O(1/n) (μ̄=3/λ, μA=3/(2λ²)): muNum = ∑ erdosWeight·rhoDrop, rhoDrop=3(√n−√(n−m));
expand erdosWeight via erdosWeight_sub_model_le (main-range weighted error O(1/n) using moments shifted
2,3,4→3,4,5 + sigmaMoment_le_power_sharp), model side via sqrt_drop_second_order + the two-term sigmaMoment
expansions; weighted tails via leftBlockMajorant (×(k+1) factor, exp still wins); normalize by kernelMass
(|kernelMass−1|≤K/n). Then two_term_local_lip ⟹ |μ̃ x − μ̃ y| ≤ K'/x = O(1/r²) ⟹ feeds
occupation_unbounded_loc (101) with c=v₀−2Rη>0.

### QUEUED DRAFTS (unverified, await server; do NOT assume correct):
- AnalyticCombinatorics/Ch8/Partitions/TwoTermLocalLip.lean — two_term_local_lip (the bridge above);
  full proof written blind, expect minor lemma-name/nlinarith fixes (abs_sub, Real.sqrt_lt_sqrt,
  div_le_div_iff₀). Verify FIRST when server recovers.

### STATUS 06-08 (Opus): LAST HARD ANALYTIC LEMMA CLOSED + course-correction
- ✅ `sigmaMoment_one_two_term` BANKED (commit ac6cf80, clean-3, 0 sorry):
  |M₁ t − (2(π²/6)/t³ − 1/(2t²))| ≤ K/t for 0<t<1. Route = Riemann-sum of
  G(x)=x·boseReg0′(x) via general `riemann_sum_Ioi_sub_integral_bound`
  (MassRateRiemannGeneral.lean — was an untracked never-built draft, now fixed+banked),
  with ∫₀^∞ G = 1/2 from G=(x·boseReg0)′−boseReg0 + improper FTC
  (`integral_Gw_Ioi`). New file: MassRateMomentOneTwoTerm.lean.
- ✅ `sigmaMoment_two_one_term` = banked `sigmaMoment_two_asymp_weak`
  (|M₂ − 6(π²/6)/t⁴| ≤ C/t³). NO new work needed.
- ✅ M₃: the μ̃ O(1/n) REMAINDER only needs an UPPER BOUND E[y³]=O(1), i.e.
  M₃ ≤ K/t⁵, which is the BANKED `sigmaMoment_le_power_sharp 3`. The sharp
  `sigmaMoment_three_one_term` (24λ²/t⁵) is NOT needed → NO order-4 boseKernel4/
  reg4 certificate required. This removes the last anticipated hard sub-wall.
- ✅ `two_term_local_lip` (brick 103, TwoTermLocalLip.lean) verified+banked earlier.
- ⇒ ALL moment inputs for the μ̃ expansion now exist. Remaining = pure ASSEMBLY
  (no hard analysis): define muNum=∑ erdosWeight·rhoDrop (rhoDrop=3(√n−√(n−m))),
  muTilde=muNum/kernelMass; split main-range (erdosWeight_sub_model_le, modelSummand
  carries the kernel expansion) + tail (leftBlockMajorant); model side via
  sqrt_drop_second_order + M₁(2-term)/M₂(1-term)/M₃(≤bound); normalize kernelMass;
  ⟹ muTilde = μ̄ + μA/√n + O(1/n); then two_term_local_lip ⟹ |μ̃ x−μ̃ y| ≤ K'/x
  = O(1/r²) ⟹ occupation_unbounded_loc (101) ⟹ ... ⟹ hhit.

### CORRECTION 06-08 (Opus): M₃ LEADING term IS needed after all (prior note wrong)
Re-derived the μ̃ order-counting two ways (modelSummand×rhoDrop product; and
decrement-moment E[m]). BOTH show: E[m]'s O(1) sub-leading term carries
`−(C/(8n²√n))·M₃`, and since M₃ ~ 24λ²/t⁵ ~ 24n^{5/2}/λ³ this is O(1), feeding
μ̃'s 1/√n coefficient μA. So an upper bound on M₃ does NOT suffice — the SHARP
leading coefficient (24λ²/t⁵) is required. Hence `sigmaMoment_three_one_term`
:= |M₃ t − 24λ²/t⁵| ≤ K/t⁴ IS on the critical path.
Construction (mirror boseKernel3/sigmaMoment_two_lambert/reg3):
  boseKernel4 z := ∑_d d⁴ e^{−dz} = e^{−z}(1+11e^{−z}+11e^{−2z}+e^{−3z})/(1−e^{−z})⁵
    (Eulerian numbers ⟨4,k⟩=1,11,11,1), ~ 24/z⁵.
  sigmaMoment_three_lambert: M₃ = ∑'_k k³·boseKernel4(tk) (differentiate M₂ identity;
    boseKernel4 = −d/dz boseKernel3).
  reg4 z := boseKernel4 z − 24/z⁵; |reg4| ≤ const near 0 (sympy poly certificate,
    like MassRateReg3) + exp tail. Then M₃ one-term mirrors sigmaMoment_two_asymp_weak.
The reg4 near-zero polynomial certificate is the hard mechanical part → dispatch.

### STATUS 06-11 (Opus master + codex worker): μ̃ 5-block assembly

(1f1d184, μ̄=3/λ μA=3/(2λ²)), #3 main_model_rho_error_le (d9f5c4c). #4 weighted_far_erdos_tail_le
(WeightedTail.lean capstone) → dispatched to uisai2 codex (xhigh, tmux hr-codex), spec /tmp/hr_spec.md,
template = unweighted far_erdos_tail_le.

### #5 FINAL ASSEMBLY decomposition (muNum two-term ⟹ hhit) — route locked
Goal: `muNum_two_term : ∃K>0, ∀ᶠ n, |muNum n − (3/massLam + (3/(2·massLam²))/√n)| ≤ K/n`,
then `muTilde_expansion_of_muNum` (already committed division lemma) ⟹ μ̃ two-term ⟹
`two_term_local_lip` (brick 103) ⟹ `occupation_unbounded_loc` (101) ⟹ hhit.

muNum n = ∑_{m∈Icc 1 (n-1)} erdosWeight n m · rhoDrop n m. Set M = ⌊n^{2/3}⌋. Decompose
muNum − (μ̄+μA/√n) = [#2: ∑'_{all m} modelSummand·rhoDropModel − (μ̄+μA/√n)]  (≤K/n, DONE)
  + (muNum − ∑'_{all m} modelSummand·rhoDropModel), and the latter error splits as:
  (A) main-range model error (Icc 1 M): ∑(erdosWeight·rhoDrop − modelSummand·rhoDropModel)
      = #1 [(eW−mS)·rhoDropModel] + #3 [mS·(rhoDrop−rhoDropModel)] + (b) 2nd-order cross
        [(eW−mS)·(rhoDrop−rhoDropModel) ≤ |#1-bound|·|#3-bound|, even smaller, O(1/n^{3/2})].
  (B) muNum tail (Icc M+1 (n-1)): ∑ erdosWeight·rhoDrop ≤ (3/√n)·∑ erdosWeight·m
      [since rhoDrop = 3(√n−√(n−m)) = 3m/(√n+√(n−m)) ≤ 3m/√n] = (3/√n)·#4 ≤ O(1/n^{3/2}). Needs #4.
  (C) model tail (m>M): ∑_{m>M} modelSummand·rhoDropModel ≤ K/n  [(d) NEW: like #4 but model side,
      modelSummand·rhoDropModel ≤ σ·exp·(poly), tail via poly_mul_exp_neg_sixthRoot_le_inv].
REMAINING NEW sub-blocks for #5: (b) 2nd-order cross [small, ~80 lines], (c) muNum-tail-via-#4
[needs rhoDrop≤3m/√n lemma + #4, ~60 lines], (d) model-tail [~150 lines, mirror #4/#3 pattern],
(e) main assembly [tie #1+#2+#3+#4+b+c+d, ~120 lines]. (d) is independent of #4 → parallelizable
(2nd codex worktree or self). (b),(c),(e) wait on #4.

### STATUS 06-11 evening: ★μ̃ TWO-TERM COMPLETE★ + final gap precisely diagnosed
μ̃ 两项展开彻底完成 (5/5 blocks clean-3): #1 main_kernel_error(3c1c139) #2 model_sum_two_term(1f1d184)
#3 main_model_rho(d9f5c4c) #4 weighted_far_erdos_tail(ace602d,codex) #5 muNum_two_term+muTilde_two_term
(65328be,codex). muTilde n = 3/λ + (3/(2λ²))/√n + O(1/n). Full Ch8/Partitions = 0 sorry.

FINAL GAP (codex #6 honestly documented, 0 sorry, see HANDOFF/TASK6-gap.md): wiring muTilde_two_term → hhit
needs ONE new theorem `khat_residual_active_good_occupation_tends_infty`:
- Define stochastic conditioned residual kernel KhatRes = Kres/(1−cmass) (ITERCoupling only exports the
  SUBstochastic Kres, row sum 1−cmass; no KhatRes / normalized-Umat evolution lemma yet).
- Prove conditioned walk's GoodHi active-occupation unbounded from comparable high starts, = the g(t) the
  coalescence bridge needs (g t = ∑GoodHi·Umat / umass; u(t+1) ≤ u(t) − δ·u(t)·g(t) → umass_lt_of_occupation).
CORE OBSTRUCTION (doctrine's recurring hard-bone): occupation_unbounded_loc (101) needs GLOBAL hard
bounded-increment `K x z ≠ 0 → |D z − D x| ≤ b`, but the Erdős predecessor kernel has SOFT far tails (any
large rank-jump has small prob, not zero). Need: truncate to active GoodW window (hard b there) + show the
soft-tail mass is negligible over the active horizon M~r (weighted_far_erdos_tail_le gives the tail O(1/n)),
i.e. a LOCALIZED occupation that only uses the off-window martingale + window-truncated increments. The
v0/b moments come from the product Erdős kernel off-window; η~1/r² from muTilde via two_term_local_lip.
This is design-heavy (master to design the truncation + KhatRes instantiation, then codex to grind).

## RENEWAL ROUTE UPDATE (Opus + ChatGPT ac R2, 06-14) — fixed-window Tanaka-DEFECT local time
The b-vs-W tension (occupation needs large truncation scale b~r^{1/3} for soft-tail control, but
coalescence needs fixed small window W with δ bounded below) is REAL and confirmed:
RankDropGeoMinor records minorization rate d·e^{-Cd/3} — exponential in window width, so a growing
window kills coalescence (route (c) dead). Charging every >W jump as 2R additive Tanaka error
(my abs_drift_le_soft, SoftTailDrift.lean — banked, valid, but too lossy here: 4R²·farMass=O(1)·r²→∞
at fixed W) does NOT close it either.
CORRECT object (ChatGPT R2): fixed-window crossing / Tanaka-DEFECT local time with the tent/defect
  Φ_W(d) = max(|d| - W, 0).
Non-crossing large jumps are handled by the martingale drift (they don't push |D| up on average);
crossing jumps are NOT errors — they are coalescence opportunities. Recommended stack:
  1. tanakaDefect W D x z  (per-step defect of Φ_W).
  2. defect telescope: E[Φ_W(D_T)] - E[Φ_W(D_0)] - ηT ≤ ∑_t ∑_x μ_t(x) ∑_z K(x,z)·tanakaDefect.
  3. QV/PZ growth for Φ_W: since Φ_W(d) ≥ |d| - W, the banked E|D_T| ≥ c√T lower bound transfers
     with a -W loss ⟹ E[Φ_W(D_T)] large.
  4. coalescence bridge: κ_W · defectMass_t ≤ goodMass_t.
  5. ∑_t goodMass_t ≥ κ_W ∑_t defectMass_t → ∞ ⟹ umass→0 (via CoalesceBridge) ⟹ overlap→1 ⟹ hhit.
This keeps W FIXED for coalescence and counts crossings instead of discarding far mass. SoftTailDrift's
abs_drift_le_soft stays banked as general infra but is NOT the closing route; the defect local time is.
(ac2 KhatRes-bridge query failed to capture — re-dispatch when needed.)
NOTE 06-14: uisai2 remote Lean build server began refusing SSH mid-session (host up, sshd refusing —
likely MaxStartups throttle from concurrent ssh or load). Blocks all Lean verification until restored.

## ROUTE-A DEAD + route-B structure clarified (Opus + ChatGPT ac R3, 06-14)
Re-attacked the occupation→coalescence closure. Built route-independent transfer primitives
(OccupationTransfer.lean: distPow_L1_le — t-step laws within per-step L¹ ε differ by ≤t·ε;
occupation_transfer — window-occ transfers between kernels, discrepancy (∑t)·ε). Both clean-3.

DECISIVE FINDING (route A = truncate-K̂res-at-fixed-b + transfer is DEAD):
 - occupation_unbounded_loc/eta give occ of {|D|≤b} with b = the increment bound; to lower-bound the
   FIXED coalescence window {|D|≤W} need b ≤ W. That needs hbinc(b) for small b.
 - Truncating K̂res at fixed b≤W removes the per-step mass ρ = P(|ΔD|>b). For the Erdős kernel the
   rank-drop tail is P(drop>b) ~ e^{-cb} = CONSTANT in r (NOT ~1/r²). weighted_far_erdos_tail_le only
   bounds drop > n^{2/3} (mass ~1/n), i.e. a GROWING threshold, not fixed b.
 - So truncation drift-perturbation η_tr = η + 4Rρ/(1−ρ) ~ R·ρ ~ r·const, and 2R·η_tr ~ r²·const → ∞
   ≫ v0. Hence v0_tr − 2R·η_tr < 0: occupation_unbounded_loc's hv' FAILS. Route A cannot apply.
 - ChatGPT ac R3 confirmed: route A valid only if ρ ≲ 1/R²; here ρ~const, so DEAD.

TWO SEPARATE obstructions, correctly disentangled:
 (a) TANAKA/skip: window-occupation local time needs bounded increment (to cross {|D|≤W} you must
     LAND in it); soft far jumps SKIP the window → the local-time = occupation identity breaks. This is
     what the Φ_W DEFECT (R2) fixes: Φ_W(d)=max(|d|−W,0) counts crossings robustly to skips.
 (b) 4th moment / horizon: PZ needs E[D_T⁴] ≤ C(v0T)² (quadratic, → const horizon). The banked
     quadratic 4th moment (fourth_moment_le_quadratic) needs EXACT mart + bounded incr. The η-robust
     occupation uses the TRIVIAL R⁴ → horizon ~R⁶ (useless). BUT: the Erdős increment has a FINITE 4th
     moment (e^{-cs} drop tail ⟹ ∑_s e^{-cs}s⁴ = const), so E[D_T⁴] ≤ C(v0T)² + C'T holds via a
     FINITE-4th-MOMENT hypothesis (∑_z K x z (Dz−Dx)⁴ ≤ B₄ uniform) — NO truncation needed. The current
     bricks are stated with "bounded increment b"; the right generalization is "finite per-step 4th
     moment B₄" (+ for Tanaka, the Φ_W defect instead of the indicator window).

⇒ CORRECT PATH (route B, no truncation): Φ_W-defect Tanaka (skip-robust) + finite-4th-moment PZ
  (const horizon) + a new coalescence bridge from crossing-defect → one-step coalescence mass. Uses the
  REAL η~1/r² (small, so v0−2Rη = v0−2/r > 0 ✓ — no truncation catastrophe). Concrete moments needed:
  v0>0 (rank-diff local variance), η~1/r² (two_term_local_lip, banked), B₄ (per-step 4th moment, from
  the e^{-cs} tail). The v0 second-moment is the likely genuine new analytic input (ac2 R3 pending).

## MOMENT AUDIT (ChatGPT ac2 R3, 06-14) — v0 (local variance) is the lone genuine analytic input
Classification of the three concrete moment inputs route B needs for the rank-difference walk
D = 3√(rnk X) − 3√(rnk Y):
 (2) DRIFT η: ALREADY IMPLIED modulo wiring. η = |μ̃(X) − μ̃(Y)| via muTilde_eq_drift + muTilde_two_term
     + two_term_local_lip + KhatRes_eq_prod_of_not_GoodW (off-GoodW = product kernel). Scale η = O(ρ⁻²)
     (ρ = rank ~ r). Just assembly.
 (3) INCREMENT: soft only. Product tail P(|ΔD|>b) ≤ 2K/n by union bound from the single-chain tail
     (far_erdos_tail_le). But the exported occupation theorems demand HARD hbinc (|ΔD|≤b) — a soft tail
     does NOT instantiate it. ⟹ confirms route A dead AND that route B must use the FINITE-4th-MOMENT
     occupation variant (no hard increment), not the banked bounded-increment ones.
 (1) LOCAL VARIANCE v0 > 0: THE GENUINE MISSING CONCRETE INPUT. Need a positive lower bound on
       locVar (KhatResPair) D xy  for off-GoodW high-rank pairs.
     ChatGPT target: ρSqTilde(n) = ∑ erdosWeight·rhoDrop²/kernelMass → 27/(2λ²) (single-chain
       ρ-decrement 2nd moment); product variance ≈ 2(ρSqTilde − μ̃²) > 0. The repo has sigmaMoment 2,
       modelSummand, rhoDropModel, kernel-error machinery, but NO assembled 2nd-moment theorem. This is
       the concrete lemma to add — a parallel to the (huge) muNum/muTilde 1st-moment assembly.
     OPUS NOTE: for route B we only need v0 > 0 (a uniform POSITIVE LOWER BOUND), NOT the exact limit
       27/(2λ²). Likely far cheaper via a TWO-CLUMP argument: the jump m has ≥δ₁ mass on [a√n,1.5a√n]
       and ≥δ₂ mass on [2a√n,2.5a√n] (separated), so Δρ takes two separated values w.p. ≥δ ⟹
       Var(Δρ) ≥ δ·(gap)² > 0. Uses banked window-mass / σ(m)≥m bounds, avoids the full 2nd-moment
       Lambert assembly. THIS is the recommended next concrete build for v0.
 Also: TASK8-gap.md — no theorem yet instantiates KhatRes drift/QV/increment on the ACTIVE domain
   (global occupation hyps fail on killed/frozen boundary rows); the localized (off-window-only)
   occupation + active-horizon statement is still needed.

### Route B remaining build (pinned, gated on v0):
 1. v0 > 0 lower bound (two-clump argument) — the gating analytic input.
 2. Φ_W defect Tanaka telescope (TentDefect.lean base banked: tentW + props + expected_tentW_ge).
 3. finite-4th-moment occupation (η-approx-mart + finite per-step 4th → const horizon).
 4. crossing→coalescence bridge (κ_W·defectMass ≤ goodMass → CoalesceBridge).
 5. active-domain KhatRes instantiation (TASK8-gap).

## OCCUPATION CAPSTONE = greenT (ChatGPT ac R4, 06-15) — Tanaka occupation is the WRONG tool
Confirmed the κ_W one-pass self-consistency wall (off-window |D|-drift ≤ η + κ_W, κ_W=e^{−cW}·const
fixed; single-window single-pass gives occ ~ e^{cW}/W < 1/δ_W = e^{cW}, loses by log). FIX = multi-pass
expected window LOCAL TIME = greenT, NOT terminal Φ_W defect / occupation_unbounded_*.
 - RIGHT capstone (BANKED): ITERGreen.occupation_ge_green_tight (greenT ≥ any Poisson subsolution at
   start − tail) + ITERGreenT.greenT_subsolution (finite-horizon greenT IS a subsolution for free).
   occupation_unbounded_eta/_loc are WRONG (hard hbinc + terminal E|D_T| growth + κ_W wall).
 - The lone remaining analytic theorem: greenT_lower_fixed_window : c·√T ≤ ∑_{t<T} window-occupation,
   for the conditioned residual rank-diff walk. Inputs: {v0>0, η~1/r², finite 4th moment B4, |D|≤R}
   PLUS local accessibility = the banked drop-1/drop-2 minorization (RankDropMinor.lean:
   ∀x p ≤ ∑_z K x z·1[D z = D x±1]). Green algebra removes κ_W (changes the object) but the
   recurrence/local-time lower bound is the genuine wall.
 - Clean route: occupation_ge_green_tight + greenT_subsolution (banked) + greenT_le_T + NEW
   greenT_lower_fixed_window (explicit Poisson subsolution g on {−R..R}: K·g ≤ g − 1[|D|≤W], g(start)
   ≥ c√T, via drop-minor p + drift + range) → CoalesceBridge. T ~ active horizon ~ R², √T ~ R → ∞.

### v0 progress (this run, all clean-3): product_locVar_ge (VarianceLower) + Pker_subwindow_mass +
khatResPair_locVar_eq_of_not_GoodW (VarianceConcrete). Remaining for v0: ρ-decrement two-clump
separation (jump sub-windows [s,6s/5],[9s/5,2s], √x−√k ≈ m/(2√x), gap ≥ const via √(x−2s) ≥ √x/√2 for
x≥16). Then v0 = δ₁δ₂(hi−lo)² > 0 via product_locVar_ge + the bridge.

## greenT_lower_fixed_window = the lone analytic wall (ChatGPT ac R5, 06-15)
ac R5: greenT_lower_fixed_window (c√T ≤ greenT/window-occupation) is "the only genuine analytic wall",
"a local-CLT/Green theorem in substance" even deterministically — NO clean universal subsolution for the
soft-tailed kernel (the tent/quadratic only works for nearest-neighbor/hard-increment). Proof shape:
multi-block heat-kernel lower bound — from |D|≤L√m, prob ≥c/√m to hit window in m steps (via ±1
minorization); sum O(T/m) blocks → c√T. Banked stack: greenT_subsolution + occupation_ge_green_tight;
need (small) greenT_le_T + (the wall) greenT_lower_fixed_window. Scaling: T~R active horizon ⟹
greenT ≳ √R → ∞ ≥ 1/δ_W (fixed W). R6 dispatched: block lemma via p-lazy-SRW domination + elementary
∑P(S_t=0)≥c√T.

## R7–R8 (06-15): wall narrowed to `erdos_rankdiff_block_heat_lower`; two shortcuts REFUTED
ChatGPT ac R7+R8 + ac2 R7 settled the structure of `greenT_lower_fixed_window`:

REFUTED shortcuts (do NOT attempt):
 - **Lazy-SRW domination** (K ≥ p·δ_{±1}+(1−2p)·δ_0): FALSE. Bare ±1 minorization only gives
   K ≥ Q = p·δ_{+1}+p·δ_{-1} (substochastic, mass 2p); Q^t has mass (2p)^t so ∑Q^t·1_W ≤ 1/(1−2p)
   = O(1), NOT √T. The residual is NOT a hold kernel — without a stay-minorization mass (1−2p) it
   can jump away. Counterexample: K(0,±1)=p, K(0,±3)=(1−2p)/2, symmetric, finite 2nd/4th moment,
   ±1-minorized, but P(|D_1|≤1)=2p≠1.
 - **tent/Jensen subsolution** g(d)=max(L−max(|d|−W,0),0): FALSE — g is not concave (x=W,y=W+2L,
   mid gives 0 ≥ L/2); the untruncated cone is concave but Jensen gives the WRONG direction (upper
   bound on K·g, Green subsolution needs lower). So tentW is NOT a universal soft-kernel subsolution.

STEP RANGE settled (ac R8, verified against source): `Pker n k = [1≤k<n]·erdosWeight n (n−k)/kernelMass n`
supports ALL 1≤k<n — NOT bounded-step. The √-block window is only the minorization OVERLAP window
(Pker_window_minor), not the support. One-step rank decrement can be ~3√n. So the kernel is in the
soft NONLOCAL-residual regime; the R7 obstruction is structurally real.

TWO-LAYER decomposition (the path forward):
 - **Layer 1 = `green_lower_from_block_heat`** (deterministic finite-sum BRIDGE, NOT hard): from
   (hM2: second-moment tightness ∑ distPow·D² ≤ V(m+1)) + (hblock: c0/√(m+1) ≤ block-heat window
   mass from a tight start) ⟹ c√T ≤ ∑_{t<T} window-occupation. Proof: Chebyshev gives ≥1/2 mass in
   {|D|≤Λ√(m+1)}, feed hblock via Chapman–Kolmogorov, telescope ∑1/√(m+1) ≥ c√T. ac2 R8 building
   the full Lean proof.
 - **Layer 2 = `erdos_rankdiff_block_heat_lower`** = THE lone hard wall: c0/√(m+1) ≤ P_x(|D_m|≤W)
   for |D x|≤Λ√(m+1). Route under an exp-tail hypothesis on |ΔD| (hExpTail: ∑ K x z·e^{θ|Δ|}≤Mθ,
   which the erdosWeight exp-penalty should supply): (A) truncate jumps at L_m=A·log m, tail mass
   ≤ m·M·e^{−θL_m}=o(1/√m); (B) bounded-increment block heat for the truncated kernel (the genuine
   hard combinatorial lemma — local elliptic 1-D heat lower); (C) transfer truncated→real via the
   BANKED OccupationTransfer.distPow_L1_le / occupation_transfer (L¹ error t·ε); (D) sum blocks.

BANKED THIS RUN (clean-3): CentralBinomSum.centralBinom_prob_sum_ge_sqrt (√N ≤ ∑_{m<N} C_m/4^m,
exact const 1, via 1/√(4m+1)≤C_m/4^m + telescope) — the SRW-Green helper feeding Layer-2 step (B/D).
Also OccupationTransfer (distPow_L1_le, occupation_transfer) = the Layer-2 step-C transfer, already
banked earlier this run. So of the four Layer-2 steps, C is DONE and the SRW-Green input is DONE;
the remaining hard piece is the bounded-increment block-heat lower (B) + assembling A,D.

## R9–R10 (06-15): exact-time heat lower is overkill; lone wall = finite-interval Green comparison
ChatGPT ac R9 sharpened the Layer-2 wall:
 - The EXACT-TIME heat lower `K^m(x,W) ≥ c/√(m+1)` is HARDER than needed (parity/aperiodicity +
   genuine near-diagonal local-CLT). REPLACE with the BLOCK-GREEN lower from a tight start:
       ∑_{t<m} K^t(x, {|D|≤W}) ≥ c√m   for |D x| ≤ Λ√(m+1),
   which is more robust and avoids parity. (Our banked `green_lower_from_block_heat` consumes the
   exact-time `hblock`; it is still a correct reduction, but the block-green form is the recommended
   consumer — a future bridge variant.)
 - Last-exit/skeleton convolution is NOT a shortcut: the skeleton S = p·δ_{±1} is substochastic
   (mass 2p), Sᵐ ~ (2p)ᵐ exponentially small; the residual correction being o(1/√m) is the same hard
   theorem in disguise. Tightness→window smoothing also needs a multi-step Harnack, not a one-step
   minorization.
 - THE LONE HARD WALL (ac R9 step 2): `finite_interval_green_lower_uniform_elliptic_1d` — a
   finite-interval Green/Harnack comparison inside a box I=[−L,L], L≍√m:
       killedGreen_K(I,W,x) ≥ c · killedGreen_SRW(I,W,0)
   for bounded-range, locally ±1-elliptic, small-drift 1-D kernels.  Chain: (1) lazySRW Green lower
   from centralBinom [BANKED]; (2) finite-interval Green comparison [THE WALL]; (3) time-truncation
   by 2nd moment (P(τ_I ≤ m) ≤ E[D_m²]/(L−B)²); (4) block_green ⟹ (5) global Green.  ac says this is
   finite-sum formalizable (electrical-network/gambler's-ruin for the reference SRW + bounded
   perturbation for K) but a "serious theorem"; central-binomial handles ONLY the reference SRW Green.
 - R10 dispatched: drill the comparison — resolvent positivity (A≥B≥0 substochastic ⟹ (I−A)⁻¹≥(I−B)⁻¹
   via Neumann series ∑Aᵗ ≥ ∑Bᵗ) vs Dirichlet-form/SOS comparison; resolve the "K_I not entrywise ≥
   p·SRW_I (nonlocal residual)" subtlety.

### Banked this run (clean-3, axioms {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}):
 - CentralBinomSum.lean : `centralBinom_prob_sum_ge_sqrt` (√N ≤ ∑_{m<N} Nat.centralBinom m/4^m).
 - GreenBridge.lean : `green_lower_from_block_heat` (Layer-1 bridge) + helpers (Chapman–Kolmogorov
   `distPow_expect_comp`, Chebyshev `good_mass_ge_half`, even-time block, √T-telescope).
 - VarianceConcrete.lean : `Pker_highclump` (v0 high jump-window: mass ≥ e^{-2C}/13 + ρ-decrement
   ≥ 21/10 on [x−2s, x−7s/4], x ≥ 100) — last v0 high-clump component.

## R10 staged Green-comparison program + what's now banked (06-15)
ChatGPT ac R10 decomposed the lone wall (finite-interval Green comparison) into 5 stages; ac2 R9
verified the exp-tail machinery against the repo.  Status:

 STAGE 1 [BANKED] entrywise Neumann/Green monotonicity — GreenComparison.distPow_mono +
   green_neumann_mono (0≤B≤A ⟹ ∑Bᵗ ≤ ∑Aᵗ).  Honest infra, but alone gives only O(1) (the ±1
   minorant is substochastic mass 2p<1) — NOT the Θ(L) bound.
 STAGE 2 [BANKED] SRW reference Green — CentralBinomSum.centralBinom_prob_sum_ge_sqrt.
 STAGE 3a [BANKED] SOS path-energy workhorse — GreenComparison.sq_diff_le_path_energy_nat
   ((f(d+n)−f d)² ≤ n·∑edge²), the Cauchy–Schwarz heart of the Dirichlet-form comparison.
 STAGE 3b [IN FLIGHT, ac2 R10] reversible Green-from-form: complete-the-square duality
   ⟨h,G_K h⟩ = sup_f(2⟨h,f⟩−Q_K(f)) ⟹ (Q_K ≤ Λ Q_R ⟹ G_K ≥ Λ⁻¹ G_R).  Finite-dim linear algebra.
 STAGE 3c [TODO] assemble bounded_jump_energy_le_edge_energy (E_K ≤ Λ E_SRW, Λ≍B²/p) from STAGE 3a
   + ±1 minorization + sum-swap.
 STAGE 4 [IN FLIGHT, ac R11] sector/drift perturbation — THE genuine hard residual: the actual
   kernel is nonreversible; need |E^antisym| ≤ θ√E^sym√E^sym with θ≍η→0 (small drift, r→∞) so
   Lax–Milgram coercivity ⟨(I−K)f,f⟩_π ≥ (1−θ)E^sym squeezes the nonreversible Green by the
   symmetric one.  This is the last research-level piece.
 STAGE 5 [BANKED] truncation transfer — TruncationTransfer.normalize_truncate_L1_eq_two_tail +
   truncated_block_heat_transfer (consume occupation_transfer); repo's Pker_rankDrop_tail_majorant
   (γ=C/60) supplies the exp tail; L_m = (240/C)·log m makes the block error o(1/√m).

So of the wall: stages 1,2,3a,5 BANKED clean-3; 3b+4 in flight (ChatGPT); 3c mechanical.
The lone genuinely-hard residual is STAGE 4 (sector/drift perturbation for nonreversibility).

## R11–R13 (06-15): Green-comparison program fully banked except ONE kernel-specific sector input
The Dirichlet-form Green-comparison route is now formalized stage-by-stage; the lone genuine residual
is precisely isolated. BANKED this run (all clean-3):
 - GreenForm.green_domination_of_form_le (Stage 3b: Q_K ≤ Λ Q_R ⟹ ⟨h,G_K h⟩ ≥ Λ⁻¹⟨h,G_R h⟩);
 - DirichletForm.bounded_jump_energy_le_edge_energy (Stage 3c upper: E_K ≤ 3B²·E_edge);
 - SymmetricDirichlet.greenQ_eq_half_jumpEnergy_add_killEnergy (the bridge greenQ = ½jumpEnergy +
   killEnergy) + greenQ_nonneg_of_symm_substochastic (discharges GreenForm's hQnonneg);
 - GreenComparison.{distPow_mono, green_neumann_mono, sq_diff_le_path_energy_nat}.
 - TruncationTransfer (Stage 5) + CentralBinomSum (Stage 2) earlier.

REMAINING deterministic (mechanical, in flight):
 - edge_energy_le_jumpEnergy_of_pm1_minor (Stage 3c lower: 2p·E_edge ≤ E_K from ±1 minorization) —
   ac2 R13 filling the one edge→NN-pairs subset `sorry` (masked double sum).
 - elementary discrete Poincaré (edgeSign_path_sum, point_sq_le_path_energy,
   interval_l2_le_L2_edgeEnergy) + abstract sector (aAnti_eq_div_plus_Hcut, Hcut_l2_le,
   sector_bound_from_Hcut) — ac R13 gave full skeletons; all finite-sum, bankable.

THE LONE GENUINE RESIDUAL (ac R13 verdict, kernel-specific, NOT derivable from existing repo facts):
 - `erdos_rankdiff_sector_input`: a SectorBound θ ≤ 1/2 for the actual nonreversible rank-difference
   kernel. ac R13 PROVED this does NOT follow from the row-drift bound (|D|-drift ≤ η): the drift
   controls antisymmetry only against the single test fn D, while the sector needs control against ALL
   (f,g) via the total crossing-variation Γ_e = ½∑|J(x,y)||χ_e|. Moreover counting measure is NOT
   divergence-free (Pker is row-normalized not column; Pker_mass), so the divergence term −½∑divJ·f·g
   must be carried OR a reference measure π with the killed-kernel stationarity balance
   (π_x·rowsum = ∑_y π_y K(y,x)) must be constructed — and the repo's Doeblin/minorization material
   (Pker_window_minor is an overlap lower bound, not a reversible measure) does NOT supply such π.
 - SO: the wall is now a single, well-defined, genuinely-new analytic theorem — construct π (or prove
   a direct crossing-TV + divergence bound) for the killed residual rank-diff kernel. Everything
   around it is banked or mechanical. This is the honest stopping point of the deterministic reduction.

## MILESTONE (06-15): full library compiles clean with entire Green-comparison backbone banked
Root build of AnalyticCombinatorics (8576 jobs) = SUCCESS. All 12 new clean-3 modules this run wire
together and the whole library compiles. Banked modules (all axioms {propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}, 0 sorry):
  CentralBinomSum, GreenBridge, TruncationTransfer, GreenComparison, GreenForm, DirichletForm,
  SymmetricDirichlet, Ellipticity  (+ VarianceConcrete Pker_high/lowclump).
The symmetric finite-interval Green comparison is now COMPLETE end-to-end as banked lemmas:
  E_K ≤ 3B²·E_edge (DirichletForm) ∧ 2p·E_edge ≤ E_K (Ellipticity)  [form sandwich]
  ⟹ greenQ_K ≤ (3B²/2p)·greenQ_edge via greenQ_eq_half_jumpEnergy_add_killEnergy (SymmetricDirichlet)
  ⟹ G_K ≥ (2p/3B²)·G_edge via green_domination_of_form_le (GreenForm)
  + SRW reference Green ≳ √L (CentralBinomSum) + truncated→real transfer (TruncationTransfer).
LONE remaining: (a) elementary discrete Poincaré + abstract sector (ac/ac2 in flight, finite-sum,
bankable); (b) THE genuine wall = erdos_rankdiff_sector_input (kernel-specific SectorBound θ≤1/2,
needs a reference measure π / cut-flux+divergence bound — new analysis, not from existing repo facts).

## FINAL STATE (06-15): abstract sector framework banked; root compiles (8578 jobs)
Added this run beyond the form sandwich: SectorPoincare (point_sq_le_path_energy,
interval_l2_le_L2_edgeEnergy) + SectorBound (edgeSign/grad/Jflow/divJ/Hcut/aK/aAnti/edgeEnergyOn/
SectorBound defs + Jflow_skew + sector_bound_from_Hcut_on). The abstract nonreversible sector
perturbation is now banked: GIVEN (i) the cut identity aAnti = -∑ Hcut·grad [hanti], (ii) a Hardy
bound ∑ Hcut² ≤ 8BΓ²L²·E_edge [hH], (iii) ellipticity p·E_edge ≤ aSym [helliptic], THEN
SectorBound θ with θ = √8·√B·Γ·L/p (Cauchy-Schwarz + sq_le_sq₀, sector_bound_from_Hcut_on, clean-3).

14 clean-3 modules banked this run; `AnalyticCombinatorics` root compiles (8578 jobs).
REMAINING to a complete unconditional renewal proof:
 (A) connective (mechanical, fragile ℤ-telescoping — ac R14 gave skeletons): edgeSign_path_sum,
     aAnti_eq_div_plus_Hcut (discharges hanti), Hcut_l2_le (discharges hH via SectorPoincare).
 (B) THE genuine wall: erdos_rankdiff_sector_input — discharge hanti/hH/helliptic + θ≤1/2 for the
     ACTUAL killed residual rank-difference kernel. Needs a reference measure π with the killed-kernel
     stationarity balance (or a direct crossing-TV+divergence bound); ac R13 proved this is NOT
     derivable from the repo's row-drift facts. This is the single new analytic theorem the whole
     renewal limit now rests on; everything else is banked or mechanical.

## SECTOR FRAMEWORK BANKED (06-15, R14-R16): 16 clean-3 modules; one research wall + 2 mechanical
SectorBound.lean banked (clean-3): sum_Icc_grad_of_le (ℤ gradient telescope, Int.le_induction +
top-peel — NOTE Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top and Finset.sum_Ico_eq_sum_range are ℕ-only here, use the
insert-peel route), edgeSign_path_sum (g y−g x = ∑ edgeSign·grad), aK/aAnti defs,
sector_bound_from_Hcut_on (Hardy bound + cut identity + ellipticity ⟹ SectorBound θ=√8√B·Γ·L/p,
via Finset.sum_mul_sq_le_sq_mul_sq + sq_le_sq₀). SectorPoincare banked
(point_sq_le_path_energy, interval_l2_le_L2_edgeEnergy).

REMAINING (precisely characterized):
 (mechanical, ac R15/R16 proof sketches need Mathlib-shape adaptation — deferred this run):
   • aAnti_eq_div_plus_Hcut (the cut identity, discharges sector_bound's `hanti`): ac's proof uses
     `unfold aAnti aK; rw [Finset.sum_sub_distrib]` but the unfold gives `(∑A − ∑B)/2` (subtraction
     between two sums, not inside one), so sum_sub_distrib doesn't match; needs a reshaped proof.
   • Hcut_l2_le_boundary (discharges `hH`): ac R15 CORRECTED my false statement (boundary edge needed:
     RHS must be edgeEnergyOn (Icc (a−1)(b−1)), not (Icc a (b−1)) — a constant has 0 internal edge
     energy but nonzero Hcut). Needs defs crossingTV/nearEdge + helpers abs_Hcut_le_crossingTV_sqrt_local
     + nearEdge_multiplicity_le (ac R16 in flight) + interval_l2_le_L2_edgeEnergy [banked].
 (THE genuine research wall): erdos_rankdiff_sector_input — discharge hanti/hH/helliptic + θ≤1/2 for
   the actual killed rank-diff kernel. Needs a constructed reference measure π (killed-kernel
   stationarity balance) or a direct crossing-TV+divergence bound; NOT derivable from the repo's
   row-drift facts (ac R13). This single theorem is what the unconditional renewal limit now rests on.

## aAnti CUT IDENTITY BANKED (06-15, from-scratch derivation)
aAnti_eq_div_plus_Hcut (+ aAnti_eq_J_sum, aAnti_eq_neg_sum_Hcut) now banked clean-3 in SectorBound.lean
— derived from scratch (NOT ac R15's broken-shape proof): Lemma A `aAnti = -½∑∑ Jflow·f·g` (diagonal
πfg cancels; residual K-terms combine into Jflow via an x↔y sum_comm swap), then split
`g y = g x + (g y - g x)`, substitute edgeSign_path_sum, reorder ∑_x∑_y∑_e → ∑_e∑_x∑_y, factor grad g e,
and the inner double sum is exactly 2·Hcut. This DISCHARGES sector_bound_from_Hcut_on's `hanti`.
Remaining: Hcut_l2_le_boundary (discharges hH; ac R16 helper sketches) + the genuine wall
erdos_rankdiff_sector_input.

## Hcut_l2_le BANKED (06-15): both sector form-inputs now discharged; only the kernel wall remains
Hcut_l2_le_boundary banked clean-3 in SectorBound.lean (∑ Hcut² ≤ 16BΓ²L²·edgeEnergyOn(Icc(a-1)(b-1)))
with helpers nearEdge_of_cross_left/right, nearEdge_edge_card_le, abs_le_sqrt_local_l2,
abs_Hcut_le_crossingTV_sqrt_local, nearEdge_multiplicity_le. Uses the boundary-edge energy (ac R15
correction: a constant has 0 internal edge energy but nonzero Hcut) + banked interval_l2_le_L2_edgeEnergy.
The one-edge bound uses a uniform abs_mul (no Cauchy-Schwarz); the multiplicity is ≤ 2B+3.

STATE: sector_bound_from_Hcut_on's hypotheses are now BOTH derivable from banked lemmas —
  hanti  ← aAnti_eq_neg_sum_Hcut (divergence-free cut identity), and
  hH     ← Hcut_l2_le_boundary (Hardy estimate, with Γ a crossingTV bound).
So given a reference measure π with (i) div Jflow(π,K) = 0 on the interval and (ii) crossingTV ≤ Γ
with Γ·√B·L/p ≤ 1/2, plus ellipticity p·E_edge ≤ aSym, the SectorBound θ≤1/2 follows by composition.

LONE REMAINING WALL: erdos_rankdiff_sector_input — construct such a π (or carry the divergence term)
for the actual killed rank-difference kernel and prove the crossingTV ≤ ηL cut-flux bound. This is the
single genuinely-new analytic input; the entire surrounding deterministic+abstract framework is banked.

## REFERENCE MEASURE π CONSTRUCTED (06-15): statOffset proven stationary for residual chain
Grounding erdos_rankdiff_sector_input in the actual repo revealed the renewal is modeled via the
1-D RESIDUAL CHAIN resStep p (RenewalOffset): from 0 jump to r'=d−1 w.p. p(d); from r+1 descend to r.
Its size-biased stationary law statOffset p = incrTail p/incrMean p was already built (RenewalOverlap)
but NOT proven stationary. Banked now (RenewalStationary.lean, clean-3):
  • incrTail_succ: incrTail p A = p(A+1) + incrTail p (A+1) (tail recurrence).
  • statOffset_stationary: ∑'_r statOffset·resStep r r' = statOffset r' (the residual row in r is
    supported on {0,r'+1}; two-term tsum + tail recurrence + statOffset 0 = 1/μ).
KEY: a STATIONARY π makes the sector cut-flux divergence divJ(x) = π_x·rowsum − ∑_y π_y K(y,x) ≡ 0
(infinite chain), so the divergence term of aAnti_eq_div_plus_Hcut drops — π = statOffset is the
divergence-free reference measure. This is the reference-measure half of erdos_rankdiff_sector_input.

CONTEXT (verified): the homogeneous renewal coalescence core T2.2
(homogeneousRenewal_uniform_overshoot_overlap) is DONE; the documented blocker T2.1 is the floor-rank
⌊3√n⌋ rank-drop LOCAL LIMIT, which is mathematically FALSE (frac(3√v) Θ(1)-oscillation, Erdős–Feller–
Pollard non-lattice content). The sector route uses aggregate CUT-FLUX, not a local limit, so it is a
genuine candidate to SIDESTEP the floor-rank obstruction.

REMAINING for full erdos_rankdiff_sector_input: (a) crossing-variation/cut-flux bound Γ for
Jflow(statOffset, resStep) (the antisymmetric magnitude); (b) finite-window/killing boundary correction
to divJ≡0 (statOffset stationarity is for the infinite chain; the windowed/killed chain leaks mass at
edges); (c) connecting the 1-D residual-chain sector Green to the two-copy coalescence. (a)+(b) are
concrete next; (c) is the modeling bridge.

## R17–R18 (06-15): ChatGPT Pro two-tab verdict — PAIR-LEVEL is the right object; Γ is genuinely new
Both Pro tabs (ac strategic, ac2 concrete) answered R17 decisively. Synthesis:

### ac (strategic crux) verdict
- The sector route AVOIDS the false local limit Pker_rankDrop_asymptotic — NOT blocked by it.
- BUT Γ (cut-flux) is a GENUINE NEW analytic theorem, NOT implied by the banked aggregates
  (minorization / tail-majorant / moments). Γ is an L¹ ANTISYMMETRIC-CURRENT bound — strictly stronger
  than tail/moment control; one can preserve ±1 minorization + exponential tails + first/second moments
  while adding a bounded-jump antisymmetric circulation that the sector |J| sees but scalar drift misses.
- The formulation MUST be PAIR-LEVEL: D(x,y)=rnk x−rnk y is a COORDINATE on KhatResPair, NOT a Markov
  lump (the pair walk is NOT lumpable w.r.t. D). So statOffset_stationary (single residual chain) is
  NOT automatically stationarity for KhatResPair (conditioning inside the good window removes common
  mass). Two valid Lean paths: (A) generalize aAnti_eq_div_plus_Hcut / Hcut_l2_le_boundary /
  sector_bound_from_Hcut_on from ℤ-states to pair states with observable D; (B) weak D-projection:
  define ΠD = D-pushforward, KD = D-projected kernel, prove pairAK = aK(ΠD,KD) for D-pullback test fns,
  then the 1-D lemmas apply verbatim. NOT strong lumping.
- New-lemma list (banked machinery → erdos_rankdiff_sector_input, pair-level):
  pair_D_weak_lump_forms · pair_stationary_or_fiber_divergence_free · pair_pm1_minorization_from_rankDropMinor ·
  pair_D_tail_truncation_from_rankDrop_tail · pair_crossingTV_bound_erdos (THE crux, floor phase summed
  uniformly) · pair_sector_to_block_heat_input.

### ac2 (concrete single-chain template) verdict — the residual chain worked out EXACTLY
- crossingTV on PREFIX window [0,b]: Γ_b(e) = (2τ_{max(2,e+1)} − τ_{b+1})/μ ≤ 2τ₂/μ, BUT B≈b (nonlocal
  0→b jump), so θ does NOT shrink as b grows. Prefix windows are the wrong shape.
- crossingTV on POSITIVE window [a,b] (1≤a): chain is NEAREST-NEIGHBOR inside (B=1, no 0-jump),
  Γ = τ_{e+1}/μ ≤ τ_{a+1}/μ — TAIL-CONTROLLED, shrinks as the lower edge a is pushed into the tail.
- Window/killing divergence correction: divJ on [0,b] = boundary atoms ±statOffset(b+1) (escaped mass
  τ_{b+1}/μ); on [a,b] the L¹ divergence = 2τ_{a+1}/μ (interior NOT zero when a>0 — the removed state 0
  no longer cancels positive-state bulk). So statOffset stationarity (divJ≡0) is INFINITE-VOLUME only;
  the windowed chain leaks and the divergence term must be CARRIED, not dropped.
- Fix: a new abstract `sector_bound_with_divergence_on` carrying Δ (the divergence term), giving constant
  (√8·√B·Γ·L + Δ)/p (or (4·…) since banked Hcut_l2_le_boundary const is 16, not 8). For positive window
  [a,b]: θ ≤ L(√8+1)/p · τ_{a+1}/μ ≤ 1/2 by pushing a out. THIS is the smallness mechanism.

### R18 dispatched (06-15, both tabs, dispatch-before-process)
- ac R18: drive PAIR-LEVEL — (1) cheapest path A-vs-B for pair_D_weak_lump_forms; (2) THE crux
  pair_crossingTV_bound_erdos (does the single-chain τ_{a+1}/μ template carry to KhatResPair with
  frac(3√v) summed away, from banked tail-majorant + drop-minorization? quantify product-reference
  non-stationarity divergence); (3) final ordered lemma list mechanical-vs-genuine.
- ac2 R18: COMPLETE compiling proofs (no sorry) of (1) abstract sector_bound_with_divergence_on
  (immediately bankable, reusable 1-D AND pair-level) + (2) the generic divergence-form ≤
  ½L(∑|D|)√Ef√Eg helper. ac2's R17 residual flow/crossingTV/divJ lemmas are the concrete template.

NET STATUS: reference-measure half banked (statOffset_stationary). The genuinely-new remaining analytic
content is the PAIR-LEVEL cut-flux bound pair_crossingTV_bound_erdos; the divergence-carrying sector
theorem (sector_bound_with_divergence_on) is the immediately-bankable abstract piece (ac2 R18 producing).

## R18 ROADMAP (06-15): pair-level route fully mapped — path B (weak D-projection), 15-lemma list
ChatGPT-Pro R18 (ac) returned the complete decisive roadmap. VERDICT: use **(B) weak D-projection**,
NOT a fresh pair-state reproof (which hits a weighted-fiber/multiplicity problem in the pair Hardy
lemma). Build the D-pushforward πD, projected kernel KD, prove pairAK = aK πD KD, then ALL banked 1-D
sector lemmas (aK/aAnti/Jflow/divJ/Hcut/crossingTV/sector_bound_from_Hcut_on/sector_bound_with_divergence_on)
apply verbatim.

### THE make-or-break trap (must audit before deep coding): p_pair = FORM CONDUCTANCE
sector_bound_from_Hcut_on consumes helliptic: p·edgeEnergyOn ≤ aSym — p is a FORM-conductance constant,
NOT the raw ±1 transition minorization (rankDropKer v 1,2 ≥ η). Since πD(d) ~ τ_d/μ DECAYS as the
positive window edge a is pushed out, p_pair may decay at the SAME rate as Γ_pair — then Γ_pair/p_pair =
O(1), does NOT →0, and "push the window out" FAILS. Closing condition is Γ_pair ≤ p_pair/(2L(cH√Btr+1)),
NOT Γ_pair→0. R19 dispatched (both tabs) to settle this decay race concretely (incl. adversarial: the
residual chain is NON-REVERSIBLE pure-descent, so symmetric-form ellipticity p may be illusory and a
direct Green/hitting estimate may replace the spectral denominator). THIS decides if the route closes.

Two SEPARATE inputs, don't conflate: pair_crossingTV_bound_product (stationary, clean) vs
pair_divergence_defect_bound_KhatRes (conditioning defect). Γ_pair shape: Cπ(a+1)exp(−γπa) +
Cjump(a−Wgood+1)exp(−γjump(a−Wgood)); 2nd term vanishes for truncated kernel with Wgood+Btr<a.

### Banked this session (clean-3, [propext,Classical.choice,Quot.sound], 0 sorry):
- SectorBoundDivergence.lean: sector_bound_with_divergence_on (Layer B #7). commit 6ef9ecf, pushed.
- DProjection.lean: ΩD/πD/massD/KD + πD_mul_KD_eq_massD (#2) + sum_over_D_fibers (#3). (NOTE: Π is a
  reserved Lean binder token — used lowercase π; πD identifier.)
NEXT after R19 verdict: if route survives, build #4,#5 (pure regrouping, framework-independent), then
Layer C. If R19 says p_pair is illusory (non-reversible), pivot the denominator to a Green/hitting
estimate (cut identity + crossingTV remain valid; only the closing ellipticity step changes).
