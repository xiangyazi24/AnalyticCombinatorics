# RUN_LOG

## Run 2026-06-03 (automode, whole-book)
- doctrine: DOCTRINE.md (whole-book F&S, audit-passing)
- approval: standing /goal "完成全书形式化, 以通过 audit 为准" + /automode
- starting avenue: (a) Ch V — meromorphic coefficient transfer (F&S IV.10)
- pre-run reconcile: salvaged remote HAdmissible(645L)+design docs (84238ab,c092bda); git-based
  remote (uisai1 git checkout, .lake preserved, rsync retired); baseline green (8322 jobs, axioms clean);
  dedicated codex worker ac-codex up; C-group spot-audit Catalan/Fib/Transfer-VI.3/Bell/Surjections = FAITHFUL (AUDIT_STATUS.md, 42bff08); UNDERSTANDING corrected (0b820c6).
- avenue (a) progress:
  - meromorphic-transfer brick (codex): DONE — Ch5/Meromorphic/Transfer.lean, 7 theorems, FAITHFUL,
    all #print axioms clean, full build green (8323 jobs), committed 1d0f262.
  - surjections asymptotic brick (codex): DONE — Ch5/Meromorphic/Surjections.lean, 15 theorems,
    FAITHFUL (incl. hard transcendental remainder differentiable on closedBall 2 via dslope),
    surjectionsCount n/n! ~ 1/(2(log2)^(n+1)) (Fubini numbers), build green 8324 jobs, axioms clean,
    committed fa90671. Avenue (a) Ch V core delivered.
- avenue (b) Ch VII opened:
  - ternary trees / Fuss-Catalan brick (codex): DONE — Ch7/SingularityApp/TernaryTrees.lean, 20 thms,
    FAITHFUL, T_n=C(3n,n)/(2n+1) ~ (27/4)^n √3/(4√π n^{3/2}). codex rejected my wrong target constant,
    proved true Stirling value (有来有往). build green 8325, axioms clean, committed 126b7c6.
  - DISCOVERY: TransferGeneral.transfer_theorem covers ALL α (α≠-m), incl √-singularities (α=-1/2).
    Singularity-analysis framework is complete → Ch VI/VII tree results unlocked.
  - Motzkin brick: DONE (4 sub-bricks) — Ch7/SingularityApp/Motzkin.lean, UNCONDITIONAL FAITHFUL,
    M_n ~ (3√3/(2√π))·3^n·n^{-3/2}. v1 = vacuous impostor (caught by trust-but-verify) → v2 found
    the hsing contradiction → v3 corrected (centered architecture) + proved Δ-domain analyticity +
    denominator nonvanishing + singular expansion → v4 closed power-series bridge (quadratic branch
    uniqueness). build green 8326, axioms clean, committed 323a011.
  - Fuss-Catalan general p-ary brick (codex): DONE — Ch7/SingularityApp/FussCatalan.lean, FAITHFUL,
    fussCatalan p n ~ (√p/((p-1)^{3/2}√(2π)))·(p^p/(p-1)^{p-1})^n·n^{-3/2} for all p≥2; Catalan/ternary
    cross-checks + fussCatalan 3 = ternaryTreeCount proved in Lean. build green 8327, axioms clean,
    committed eca8d96.
- avenue (c) Ch IX opened:
  - quasi-powers / Gaussian limit law brick (codex): DONE — Ch9/LimitLaws/QuasiPowers.lean, opens Ch IX.
    Mathlib Levy continuity theorem PRESENT (tendsto_iff_tendsto_charFun) → quasi-powers Gaussian limit
    law (X_n−β_n u₁)/√(β_n u₂)→d N(0,1) proved, + mean/variance asymptotics. FAITHFUL framework
    (conditional on genuine quasi-powers hypothesis, satisfiable). build green 8328, axioms clean,
    committed c2a024b.
- Session FAITHFUL deliverables (6): Ch5 meromorphic transfer (IV.10), Ch5 surjections/Fubini,
  Ch7 ternary, Ch7 Motzkin (impostor caught+fixed), Ch7 Fuss-Catalan general, Ch9 quasi-powers limit law.
  Opened Ch V, Ch VII, Ch IX. Whole-tree Group-A/C audit clean. Caught+fixed 1 vacuous impostor.
  - quasi-powers fidelity fix + instance (codex): DONE — instance-attempt PROVED the committed hChar was
    over-strong (global exp identity unsatisfiable for lattice laws; charFun oneBitCountLaw π=0). Honestly
    downgraded (9dd62c4), then weakened hChar to LOCAL form (faithful Hwang) + proved unconditional
    binary-word CLT (#ones →d N(0,1)). build green 8329, axioms clean, committed 5a0f4b8. Ch IX now has a
    faithful framework + a non-vacuous instance.
  - permutation cycle-count CLT (codex, 2 sub-bricks): DONE — Ch9/LimitLaws/PermutationCycles.lean,
    UNCONDITIONAL FAITHFUL. (C_n−H_n)/√H_n →d N(0,1) (Goncharov), Feller-coupling realization; cycle_hChar
    (local quasi-powers) proved, scaled log-sum remainder closed. build green 8330, axioms clean,
    committed 2463a33. Ch IX now: faithful framework + 2 unconditional instances.
- Session FAITHFUL deliverables (8): Ch5 meromorphic transfer (IV.10), Ch5 surjections/Fubini, Ch7 ternary,
  Ch7 Motzkin (impostor caught+fixed), Ch7 Fuss-Catalan general, Ch9 quasi-powers limit law (over-strong
  hChar caught+fixed), Ch9 binary-word CLT, Ch9 permutation cycle CLT. Opened Ch V, VII, IX with
  framework + instance(s) each. Whole-tree Group-A/C audit clean. Trust-but-verify caught + fixed 2
  fidelity issues (Motzkin-v1 vacuous, quasi-powers hChar over-strong).
  - 2-regular graphs asymptotic (codex): DONE — Ch7/SingularityApp/TwoRegular.lean, g_n/n! ~
    e^{-3/4}/√(πn) via general transfer (α=1/2, entire prefactor). FAITHFUL as GF-coefficient asymptotic
    (count defined via EGF — weakest fidelity this run, honestly flagged). build green 8331, axioms clean,
    committed a339174.
- Session FAITHFUL deliverables (9): Ch5 meromorphic transfer, Ch5 surjections/Fubini, Ch7 ternary,
  Ch7 Motzkin, Ch7 Fuss-Catalan, Ch9 quasi-powers framework, Ch9 binary-word CLT, Ch9 cycle CLT,
  Ch7 2-regular (GF-coeff). Opened Ch V, VII, IX. Whole-tree audit clean. 2 fidelity issues caught+fixed.
- fidelity note: prefer genuine combinatorial definitions (surjections/ternary/Motzkin/Fuss-Catalan have
  them); 2-regular drifted to GF-coeff definition — future bricks should re-anchor to real counts.
  - CODEX OUTAGE (05:27 CDT): gpt-5.5 usage limit hit. Handled per automode hard-stop: (i) Opus-authored
    Fuss-Catalan p=4/5/6 instances (ab9a48a, build green 8332); (ii) updated UNDERSTANDING (56be2cb);
    (iii) bridge command auto-waited to 05:29 reset then re-dispatched composition-parts.
  - composition part-count CLT (codex, auto-bridged): DONE — Ch9/LimitLaws/CompositionParts.lean,
    HIGH-FIDELITY (card {c:Composition n//c.length=k}=C(n-1,k-1) proved via compositionAsSetEquiv —
    genuine combinatorial object, re-anchoring after 2-regular's GF-coeff drift). #parts →d N(0,1).
    committed 398ac98.
- Session FAITHFUL deliverables (11): meromorphic transfer, surjections, ternary, Motzkin, Fuss-Catalan
  general, quasi-powers framework, binary-word CLT, cycle CLT, 2-regular (GF-coeff), Fuss-Catalan
  p=4/5/6 instances (Opus), composition-parts CLT. Opened Ch V/VII/IX. Whole-tree audit clean.
  2 fidelity issues caught+fixed; codex outage bridged.
  - alignments (codex): DONE — Ch5/Meromorphic/Alignments.lean, HIGH-FIDELITY (genuine alignmentClass),
    o_n/n! ~ (1/(e-1))(e/(e-1))^n; codex corrected brief's wrong OEIS values. committed f235290, green 8334.
  - supercritical-seq schema (codex): DONE-with-fidelity-fix — codex dressed dominant_simplePole with
    UNUSED supercritical C-hypotheses (3rd fidelity catch this run). Removed decorative hyps; committed
    honest thin SEQ-form-constant transfer (d64a98c, green 8335). Genuine V.2 (derive decomposition from
    C(ρ)=1) flagged future work.
- Session FAITHFUL deliverables (13): meromorphic transfer, surjections, ternary, Motzkin, Fuss-Catalan
  general + p=4/5/6, quasi-powers framework, binary-word CLT, cycle CLT, 2-regular (GF-coeff),
  composition-parts CLT, alignments, supercrit transfer (thin). Opened Ch V/VII/IX. Whole-tree audit clean
  (build green 8335). 3 fidelity issues caught+fixed (Motzkin-v1 vacuous, quasi-powers hChar over-strong,
  supercrit decorative hyps); codex outage bridged.
  - 2-regular fidelity upgrade (codex): DONE — TwoRegularClass.lean, genuine SET-of-undirected-cycles
    count, EGF derived, counts=old GF-coeff count proved; asymptotic now for the genuine count. The one
    flagged fidelity gap is CLOSED. (My Audit #print-axioms namespace path was wrong → full build caught
    it, lake env lean had missed it — lesson: always run the integrated build, not just env lean.)
    committed 2c7796b/63b7695, green 8336.
- CAPSTONE (2026-06-04): 88 files, build green 8336 jobs, 0 sorry/admit/native_decide/custom-axiom;
  ~160 headline theorems #print-axioms-certified clean. Opened Ch V (meromorphic transfer + surjections +
  alignments + supercrit-transfer), Ch VII (ternary, Motzkin, Fuss-Catalan general+p=4/5/6, 2-regular
  genuine), Ch IX (quasi-powers framework + binary-word + cycle + composition-parts CLTs). 3 fidelity
  issues caught+fixed; 1 gap closed; codex outage bridged. ~38 commits.
  - genuine V.2 supercrit (codex): DONE — SupercriticalSeqGenuine.lean, decomposition DERIVED from
    C(ρ)=1 simple (dslope removable-singularity subtraction), no assumed decomposition. The thin-wrapper's
    flagged future-work is CLOSED. committed d5b0241, green 8337.
- CAPSTONE v2 (2026-06-04): 89 files, build green 8337, 0 sorry/admit/native_decide/custom-axiom; ~162
  headline theorems #print-axioms-certified. Opened Ch V/VII/IX. ALL flagged fidelity gaps closed
  (2-regular → genuine count; supercrit → genuine V.2). 3 fidelity issues caught+fixed; codex outage
  bridged. ~40 commits. Every fidelity concern raised this run has been resolved.
- next (genuinely multi-session): hard saddle/circle-method (Bell/involutions/Hardy-Ramanujan partitions);
  more Ch V/VII/IX breadth; multivariate (Ch IX); appendices A/B/C.
  - exp HAdmissible instance (codex): DONE — Ch8/SaddlePoint/ExpHAdmissible.lean, FULL instance
    expHAdmissible : HAdmissible Complex.exp (local_uniform + tail_uniform proved), exp asymptotic derived
    THROUGH the general Hayman coeff_isEquivalent_saddle → interface now NON-VACUOUS. Closes the original
    session-start CONDITIONAL gap (task #3). instance axioms clean. committed 9b7d2bd, green 8338.
- CAPSTONE v3 — EVERY flagged fidelity concern this run is now CLOSED:
  (1) Motzkin v1 vacuous impostor → rebuilt unconditional;
  (2) quasi-powers hChar over-strong → weakened to faithful local form + binary-word instance;
  (3) supercrit decorative hyps → removed, then genuine F&S V.2 derived (decomposition from C(ρ)=1);
  (4) 2-regular GF-coeff → upgraded to genuine SET-of-cycles combinatorial count;
  (5) original Ch8 HAdmissible no-instance → exp instance constructed, general interface non-vacuous.
  State: 91 files, build green 8338, 0 sorry/admit/native_decide/custom-axiom, ~164 headline theorems
  #print-axioms-certified. Opened Ch V/VII/IX. ~41 commits.
- next (genuinely multi-session): hard saddle/circle-method (Bell/involutions/Hardy-Ramanujan partitions);
  Ch V/VII/IX breadth; multivariate; appendices A/B/C.
- end: <comprehensive capstone; all flagged gaps closed; campaign continues per doctrine across sessions>
- final result: <ongoing — book is multi-session; this run delivered 16 faithful results + opened 3 chapters>


## Run continued — hard saddle phase
- Bell HAdmissible (codex): DONE — BellHAdmissible.lean (849L), full instance for e^{e^z-1} (Hayman
  flagship), saddle r·e^r=n genuine, all fields incl local/tail uniform proved, B_n/n! ~ saddleScale via
  the general interface, tied to posInt.set.counts. Deep-audited genuine. green 8339, axioms clean,
  committed 4235801. (17th deliverable; 92 files.)
- next: involutions (e^{z+z²/2}, another Hayman instance); then Hardy-Ramanujan partitions (circle method,
  hard); breadth; appendices.
- involutions HAdmissible (codex): DONE — InvolutionHAdmissible.lean (912L), 3rd Hayman instance
  (e^{z+z²/2}), genuine count parts12.set (verified parts12=(0,1,1,0,…) atom class). green 8340, clean,
  committed d62b396. (18th deliverable; 93 files, 21,171 L total.)
- set-partition block-count CLT (codex): NOT BANKED — codex honestly reduced it to a single
  `def BellBlockSaddleCoefficientAsymptoticsObligation : Prop` that CONTAINS the substance (mean ~ n/log n,
  variance ~ n/(log n)², AND the bivariate-Bell charFun quasi-powers expansion). The Gaussian conclusion
  follows trivially from that obligation, so this is the "hard part bundled into a hypothesis" / def:Prop
  pattern — NOT a faithful result. Per audit discipline, NOT wired into the tree, NOT counted as a
  deliverable. The obligation = genuine hard multi-session sub-goal (parameter-uniform bivariate Bell
  saddle, beyond the univariate BellHAdmissible). Flagged future work. (SetPartitionBlocks.lean left on
  uisai1 as scaffolding, unwired.)
- audit lesson reaffirmed: a CLT "conditional on" an obligation that contains the mean/variance/expansion
  is not progress — refuse to bank it (substrate: 不容忍把数学负担塞进假设).
- Schröder (codex): DONE — Schroeder.lean (852L), genuine recurrence (verified vs A006318 incl S_10),
  S_n ~ C·(3+2√2)^n·n^{-3/2}, OGF zS²+(z-1)S+1=0. green 8341, clean. committed 820e226. (19th deliverable.)
- coverage note: tractable frontiers largely covered (3 chapters, frameworks+instances, 3 saddle instances,
  algebraic/explicit/meromorphic-SEQ/limit-law families). Remaining is the HARD frontier: Hardy-Ramanujan
  circle method (partitions), bivariate saddles (set-partition blocks — flagged), multivariate, appendices.
- Riordan (codex): DONE — Riordan.lean (751L), genuine first-return def R=1+z²MR (vs A005043 incl R_10=603),
  R_n ~ (3√3/(8√π))·3^n·n^{-3/2}. green 8342, clean. committed 915e95b. (20th deliverable.)
- PIVOT: algebraic √-family (Motzkin/Schröder/Riordan) well-covered; turning to NEW territory —
  two-dominant-pole meromorphic transfer (tangent numbers, tan z poles ±π/2), then conjugate/higher-order
  poles, log-singularity transfer, appendices.
- tangent numbers (codex, 2 sub-bricks): DONE — Tangent.lean (789L), UNCONDITIONAL. First two-dominant-pole
  meromorphic transfer (tan poles ±π/2, residue −1); remainder analytic to closedBall 3 proved → T_n/n! ~
  2(2/π)^{n+1} (odd n). green 8343, clean. committed c620359. (21st deliverable; new two-pole machinery.)
- secant/Euler numbers (codex): DONE — Secant.lean (609L), UNCONDITIONAL, reused tangent two-pole
  machinery; E_{2n}/(2n)! ~ 2(2/π)^{2k+1}, numeric → 0.99995. green 8344, clean. committed 1296edb. (22nd.)
- coverage: Ch V (single+two-pole meromorphic + 4 apps + supercrit V.2), Ch VII (6 algebraic/singularity),
  Ch IX (framework + 3 CLT), Ch VIII (3 Hayman saddle instances). Reusable machinery built. All fidelity
  gaps closed. Next genuinely-new: log-singularity transfer (VI.2), then circle method / appendices / multivariate.
- log-singularity coeff scale (codex): DONE — LogSingularity.lean (183L), leading-order β=1
  [z^n](1-z)^{-α}log(1/(1-z)) ~ (n^{α-1}/Γα)log n (α>1), α=2 ~ n log n. Full analytic log-transfer +
  general β honestly reported-open. green 8345, clean. committed 721fa0c (+b13b48e import fix). (23rd.)
  (process note: forgot Audit import — full build caught the unknown-constant; env-lean had missed it.)
- blocks≤3 saddle (codex): DONE — Blocks3HAdmissible.lean (1067L), 4th Hayman instance e^{z+z²/2+z³/6},
  genuine count parts123.set (set partitions blocks ≤3). green 8346, clean. committed 4a8d953. (24th.)
- PIVOT to implicit-function schema (F&S VII.4): tree function T=ze^{T}, √-singularity at 1/e.
- tree function / Cayley (codex): DONE — TreeFunction.lean (namespaced TreeFunctionNS to avoid helper
  collision with FussCatalan), n^{n-1}/n! ~ e^n/(√(2π)n^{3/2}); codex corrected my exponent (3/2 not 5/2).
  green 8347, clean. committed 8f9101e (+145a36f namespace fix). (25th deliverable.)
- build-integration lessons this run: (a) forgot Audit import (logsing); (b) helper-name collision
  (treefun vs fusscatalan). Both caught by the FULL build (not env-lean) → namespace agent files +
  always full-build before banking.
- rooted forests (codex): DONE — Forests.lean (namespaced ForestsNS), rootedForest n=(n+1)^{n-1}
  (Cayley-Prüfer), shift identity to tree function; (n+1)^{n-1}/n! ~ e^{n+1}/(√(2π)n^{3/2}). green 8348,
  clean. committed a53289f. (26th.)
- PIVOT to a genuinely-different limit law: fixed points of a random permutation → Poisson(1) (discrete
  limit, not Gaussian; method of factorial moments). Opens the discrete-limit-law side of Ch IX.
- fixed points → Poisson(1) (codex): DONE (pmf-level) — FixedPointsPoisson.lean (namespaced), FIRST
  discrete limit law: exact factorial moments E[(F_n)_k]=1, pmf → poissonPMFReal 1 j (via derangements).
  Full weak-convergence reported-open (Mathlib lacks pmf⟹weak bridge for ℕ). green 8349, clean. 36f7a74. (27th.)
- LIMIT-LAW LANDSCAPE now covers BOTH Gaussian (binary-word/cycle/composition-parts) AND Poisson
  (fixed points) — the two canonical F&S Ch IX universal laws.
- pmf⟹weak bridge + full Poisson (codex): DONE — PMFToDistribution.lean (namespaced), reusable
  probabilityMeasure_nat_tendsto_of_tendsto_singleton (portmanteau), fixed-points → FULL
  TendstoInDistribution Poisson(1). Filled the Mathlib gap. green 8350, clean. committed 4c59db5. (28th.)
- This unlocks more discrete limit laws (the bridge is reusable). Ch IX now: Gaussian (3 instances) +
  Poisson (fixed points, full weak convergence) + reusable Gaussian (quasi-powers) & discrete (pmf) bridges.
- r-cycles → Poisson(1/r) (codex): RCyclesPoisson.lean (namespaced RCyclesPoissonNS).
  BANKED unconditional: rCyclePMFFormula_tendsto_poisson — analytic limit of the Goncharov
  inclusion-exclusion truncated-exp pmf formula (r^j j!)⁻¹·expPartial(-1/r,⌊n/r⌋-j+1) → e^{-1/r}(1/r)^j/j!
  (moving truncation ⌊n/r⌋→∞ is the crux). Genuine RV rCycleCount (cycleType.count r / fixedPointCount),
  genuine count restatement rCycleCount_eq_card_cycleFactorsFinset_filter, laws + bridge wired.
  CONDITIONAL (NOT banked as headline): full →d Poisson(1/r) general r, reduced via reusable pmf⟹weak
  bridge to the marginal cycle-count identity rCyclePMF=rCyclePMFFormula — genuine Mathlib gap (no
  marginal cycleType.count r=j enumeration / Goncharov exact count). r=1 = re-wrap of fixed-points (not banked).
  Honest conditional status; combinatorial enumeration is multi-session future work. (29th deliverable.)
- Fibonacci OGF asymptotic (codex): FibonacciCompositions.lean (namespaced FibonacciCompositionsNS).
  BANKED unconditional: natFib_succ_isEquivalent_phi — Nat.fib(n+1) ~ φ^{n+1}/√5, the textbook first
  rational-coefficient asymptotic (F&S Ch V). Genuine: partial-fraction split of 1/(1-z-z²) into poles
  ρ=1/φ (dominant) + 1/(-φ) (remainder radius>1 via FMLS estimate), coeff=Nat.fib(n+1) from recurrence
  (fibonacciSeries_mul_denominator), residue -1/√5, fed to banked dominant_simplePole_isEquivalent.
  13 theorems, 0 blocked. NOTE: fibonacciCompositionCount:=Nat.fib(n+1) by def; {1,2}-composition
  bijection NOT proved — banked the clean Nat.fib statement, not the "composition" framing. (30th deliverable.)
- Derangements D_n/n!→1/e (codex): REJECTED — NOT banked. Mathlib ALREADY proves this
  (Mathlib/Combinatorics/Derangements/Exponential.lean:27 numDerangements_tendsto_inv_e). codex's
  derangementRatio_tendsto is a restatement of that existing theorem; numDerangements_isEquivalent
  (D_n~n!/e) is cosmetic repackaging into IsEquivalent (D_n/(n!/e)=e·(D_n/n!)→1). Per playbook
  "never bank re-wrappers / zero-new-math". File left unwired/uncommitted. LESSON: grep Mathlib for the
  target theorem BEFORE dispatching a textbook limit — derangements→1/e was already there.
- r-cycle FACTORIAL-MOMENT identity (codex, hard): RCyclesFactorialMoment.lean (654L, namespace
  RCyclesPoissonNS, nested FM). BANKED unconditional, fills the documented Mathlib gap:
  * FM.cycleType_count_factorialMoment_sum_in: r^k·Σ_σ (σ.cycleType.count r)_k = (card α)! — the Goncharov
    identity, proved FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES via genuine Equiv bijections (delete a distinguished r-cycle ↔
    permute the complement) + induction over the complement. NOT a Mathlib re-wrapper (~650L combinatorics).
  * factorialMoment_rCycle: E[(C_{n,r})_k] = r^{-k} (general k, r·k≤n) over the genuine uniform perm average.
  * rCycle_mean_eq_inv: classic mean E[C_{n,r}] = 1/r.
  This is the genuine combinatorial HEART the conditional r-cycles→Poisson(1/r) was missing. Full
  distribution-level Poisson(1/r) still needs a factorial-moment⟹law bridge (separate Mathlib gap).
  0 blocked. (31st deliverable — strongest since the pmf⟹weak bridge.)
- r-cycles → Poisson(1/r) COMPLETED UNCONDITIONAL (codex, INV): RCyclesPoissonComplete.lean (349L,
  namespace RCyclesPoissonNS.Complete). 17 theorems, 0 blocked. FLAGSHIP — the number of length-r cycles
  in a uniform random permutation →d Poisson(1/r), end-to-end unconditional. Chain:
  * rCycleCount ≤ ⌊n/r⌋ (boundedness: Multiset.count_mul_le_sum + cycleType.sum=card),
  * finite_pmf_eq_factorial_moment_sum — GENERAL method-of-factorial-moments pmf inversion for bounded
    ℕ-valued r.v. on a finite space, via alternating-binomial kernel factorial_kernel_sum_eq_indicator
    (reusable Mathlib-gap filler),
  * substitute EXACT moments r^{-k} (factorialMoment_rCycle) ⟹ rCyclePMF = rCyclePMFFormula (exact Goncharov pmf),
  * discharge hformula ⟹ rCycles_tendstoInDistribution_poisson (full weak conv to Poisson(1/r)).
  Genuine, no Mathlib re-wrapper. r-cycles avenue driven to terminal: CONDITIONAL→UNCONDITIONAL. (32nd deliverable.)
- JOINT cycle factorial moments (codex, JFM): JointCycleMoments.lean (636L, namespace JointCycleMomentsNS).
  BANKED unconditional (two distinct lengths): factorialMoment_two_rCycle_of_pos — E[(C_{n,r})_a (C_{n,s})_b]
  = r^{-a}·s^{-b} for distinct positive r,s with r·a+s·b≤n (incl. fixed-point branch r or s =1), proved by
  extending the FM deletion bijection with cross-length cycle DISJOINTNESS (Equiv.Perm.Disjoint). Covariance
  corollary rCycleCount_mul_mean_eq_inv_mul_inv: E[C_{n,r}C_{n,s}]=1/(rs) (counts of two different lengths
  uncorrelated). Foundation of Goncharov–Kolchin (asymptotic independence of cycle-length counts).
  BLOCKED/documented: general >2-length family (indexed-family deletion induction is the remaining work).
  Genuine, no Mathlib re-wrapper. (33rd deliverable.)
- CODEX OUTAGE (usage limit, reset 15:29 CDT). Per protocol: Opus-authored a genuine brick myself
  (build server free, separate compute) + bridging GFM to auto-resume at reset.
- Expected number of cycles = harmonic number (Opus): ExpectedCycles.lean (namespace RCyclesPoissonNS).
  BANKED: expected_totalCycles_eq_harmonic — E[∑_{r=1}^n C_{n,r}] = ∑_{r=1}^n 1/r = H_n, by linearity
  (uniformPermExpectation_finset_sum) over the banked per-length means rCycle_mean_eq_inv. Classic Goncharov
  (a random permutation has ∼ log n cycles). Genuine consequence of the factorial-moment machinery,
  lake env lean clean. (34th deliverable; Opus-authored during outage.)
- Variance of r-cycle count (Opus, during outage): CycleVariance.lean (namespace RCyclesPoissonNS).
  BANKED: rCycle_variance_eq_inv — Var(C_{n,r}) = E[(C_{n,r})_2]+E[C_{n,r}]-(E[C_{n,r}])² = 1/r²+1/r-1/r² = 1/r
  (2r≤n), from the banked factorial moments. Second-moment confirmation of the Poisson(1/r) limit (variance 1/r).
  lake env lean clean. (35th deliverable; Opus-authored during codex outage.)
- Cycle-count covariance (Opus, during outage): added rCycle_covariance_eq_zero to CycleVariance.lean.
  BANKED: Cov(C_{n,r},C_{n,s}) = E[C_r C_s] - E[C_r]E[C_s] = 1/(rs) - (1/r)(1/s) = 0 for distinct positive
  r,s with r+s≤n. Cycle counts of distinct lengths are UNCORRELATED — second-moment shadow of
  Goncharov–Kolchin independence, from banked joint moment (factorialMoment_two_rCycle_of_pos) + means.
  lake env lean clean. (36th deliverable; Opus-authored during outage.)
- GENERAL finite-family joint factorial moments (codex, GFM — resumed after outage): JointCycleMomentsGeneral.lean
  (563L, namespace JointCycleMomentsGeneralNS). BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked — completes the Goncharov–Kolchin
  factorial-moment characterization:
  * factorialMoment_rCycle_finset: for any Finset S of distinct positive lengths, E[∏_{r∈S}(C_{n,r})_{k_r}]
    = ∏_{r∈S} r^{-k_r} (Σ r·k_r ≤ n), via the integer identity rCycleCount_factorialMoment_sum_finset
    (indexed-family deletion induction + disjointness preservation lemmas).
  * rCycleCount_prod_mean_eq_prod_inv: joint mean E[∏_{r∈S} C_{n,r}] = ∏_{r∈S} 1/r.
  The joint factorial moments FACTOR as the product of independent Poisson(1/r) factorial moments ⟹ asymptotic
  independence of cycle counts at the moment level. Genuine, no Mathlib re-wrapper. (37th deliverable.)
- Cycle-statistics cluster now comprehensively complete: r-cycles→Poisson(1/r) UNCONDITIONAL; all factorial

- BIVARIATE Goncharov–Kolchin IN DISTRIBUTION (codex, BIV): BivariateCyclePoisson.lean (675L, namespace
  RCyclesPoissonNS.Bivariate). FLAGSHIP, 0 blocked — cycle counts of two distinct lengths are asymptotically
  INDEPENDENT Poissons:
  * jointLaw_tendsto_poissonProduct: joint law of (C_{n,r},C_{n,s}) →weak Poisson(1/r) ⊗ Poisson(1/s) (r≠s).
  * probabilityMeasure_nat_prod_tendsto_of_tendsto_singleton: reusable ℕ×ℕ pmf⟹weak bridge (generalizes the
    1-D bridge; fills a Mathlib gap).
  * jointRCyclePMF_eq_formula + jointRCyclePMF_tendsto_poisson_product: bivariate pmf inversion (tensor of the
    1-D factorial-moment kernel) + exact joint moments r^{-a}s^{-b} ⟹ joint pmf → product Poisson pmf.
  Genuine end-to-end, no Mathlib re-wrapper. (38th deliverable; distributional Goncharov–Kolchin, bivariate.)
- BIV build note: first full-build of BivariateCyclePoisson was KILLED mid-Audit-job (~OOM) due to 2 concurrent
  Ripple lake builds on uisai1 (another session's SturmQrowCert work — not killed, per no-disrupt rule).
  Incremental rebuild succeeded: 8359 jobs green, 3 flagship headlines clean-3, CLEAN. (Lesson: uisai1 shared;
  heavy Audit job can OOM under concurrent builds — re-run incremental.) BivariateCyclePoisson uses
  maxHeartbeats 1000000 on heavy bivariate-measure proofs (style-linter warns for a comment; audit unaffected).
- GENERAL MULTIVARIATE Goncharov–Kolchin IN DISTRIBUTION (codex, MV — THE capstone): MultivariateCyclePoisson.lean
  (815L, namespace RCyclesPoissonNS.Multivariate). 0 blocked. THE fully general theorem:
  * multivariateLaw_tendsto_poissonPi: for ANY finite family of distinct positive lengths (injective
    lengths : Fin m → ℕ), the joint law of (C_{n,r_i})_i →weak ⨂_i Poisson(1/r_i) (ProbabilityMeasure.pi).
    Cycle counts asymptotically independent Poissons, fully general, unconditional, end-to-end.
  * probabilityMeasure_pi_nat_tendsto_of_tendsto_singleton (+pmfReal variant): reusable (Fin m → ℕ)
    pmf⟹weak bridge — generalizes the 1-D and ℕ×ℕ bridges, fills a Mathlib gap.
  * multivariatePMF_eq_formula + multivariatePMF_tendsto_poissonPiPMF: exact m-fold tensor pmf inversion
    (from the general joint factorial moments) + the joint local limit law.
  maxHeartbeats 800000 with explanatory comment (per instruction). Genuine throughout. (39th deliverable.)
- The permutation-cycle-statistics arc is now COMPLETE at full generality: marginal Poisson(1/r) (1-var),
  bivariate product Poisson, general multivariate product Poisson, all factorial moments, H_n mean, variance,
  covariance — the entire Goncharov–Kolchin theorem family formalized end-to-end.
- Ramanujan Q-function (codex, Q — diversification to Ch2/Mappings): RamanujanQ.lean (429L, namespace
  Ch2.Mappings.RamanujanQNS). PARTIAL banked honestly:
  * ramanujanQ_le_one_add_sqrt_pi_mul_nat_div_two: Q(n) ≤ 1 + √(πn/2) — the sharp upper Gaussian envelope
    (Laplace-for-sums upper comparison, genuinely new analytic technique for the repo).
  * ramanujanQ_isTheta_sqrt: Q =Θ[atTop] √n (order-sharp; eventual lower √n/4).
  NOT claimed: full Q ~ √(πn/2) — blocked on the sharp lower head expansion (two-sided log-product on
  k=o(n^{2/3}) + tail). Follow-up dispatched. Genuine sum-of-products def, lake env lean clean. (40th
  deliverable, partial.)
- Ramanujan Q FULL asymptotic (codex, Q2): RamanujanQSharp.lean (525L, namespace RamanujanQNS.Sharp).
  BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked: ramanujanQ_isEquivalent — Q(n) ~ √(πn/2), via the sharp lower head
  expansion (k=o(n^{2/3}), exp(-k(k+1)/2n - O(k³/n²))) + two-sided Gaussian sum-integral comparison + tail
  estimates; ratio → 1 (ramanujanQ_tendsto_ratio_one). 21 theorems. Completes the Laplace-method-for-sums
  technique started in RamanujanQ.lean. The Θ partial upgraded to the full equivalence same-session. (41st.)
- Generalized-Cayley forest count (codex, FOREST — PARTIAL): ForestCount.lean (224L, namespace ForestCountNS).
  Genuine functional formulation (absorbing step / Reaches / RootedForests subtype). BANKED partial:
  * abel_forest_reindexed_identity: Σ_i C(m-1,i)·k^{i+1}·m^{m-1-i} = k·(m+k)^{m-1} — the Abel-binomial
    engine (exactly what the depth-one decomposition needs for k·n^{n-k-1}).
  * base cases: k=n → 1; k+1=n → k·n^{n-k-1} (exponent 0).
  BLOCKED (precise): the sigma-bijection — partition forests by the first-generation set S (parents in R),
  restrict to sub-forest rooted at S, first-hit argument + Σ-equivalence. FOREST2 dispatched on this gap.
  Full k·n^{n-k-1} NOT yet claimed. (42nd deliverable, partial.)
- GENERALIZED CAYLEY FORMULA COMPLETE (codex, FOREST3): ForestCountComplete.lean (932L, namespace
  ForestCountNS.Complete). BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked:
  * card_rootedForests: #(forests of k rooted trees on n labeled vertices with specified root set R) =
    k·n^{n-k-1} (0<k<n), functional reaches-R formulation.
  * card_gRootedForests: the generalized-Fintype-carrier version (strong-induction substrate).
  Route: fixed-S FIBER equivalences (depth-one decomposition counted fiber-by-fiber, summed by subset size)
  — elegantly avoided the dependent-Sigma HEq entirely — + the banked Abel-binomial engine. A famous classic
  formula, not in Mathlib. Unblocks the random-mappings arc: next c_n = n^{n-1}·Q(n) ⟹ with banked
  ramanujanQ_isEquivalent, P(random mapping connected) ~ √(π/(2n)). (43rd deliverable.)
- PROTOCOL BUG caught & fixed: the per-bank sync step `git stash -u; git pull` on uisai1 STASHED codex's
  in-flight UNCOMMITTED ConnectedMappings.lean (MAPCONN machinery, deliberately left in the working tree for
  MAPCONN2 to extend). Restored from stash@{0} (+ /tmp safety copy, 692L). RULE going forward: before any
  stash+pull sync, safety-copy in-flight worker .lean files; prefer `git stash` (no -u) — untracked files
  do not block pulls except when banking that same path (then the local copy is identical; remove + pull).
- Outage #2 (codex usage limit, reset 20:31): bridge armed to auto-re-dispatch MAPCONN2 at 20:32. Opus work
  during outage: Cayley named corollary n^{n-2} (instantiation, honest label) + AUDIT_STATUS continuation
  summary.
- CONNECTED RANDOM MAPPINGS COMPLETE (codex, MAPCONN2 — resumed after outage #2): ConnectedMappings.lean
  (1102L, namespace ConnectedMappingsNS). BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked — the second flagship arc:
  * card_connectedMappings: exact count c_n = Σ_{k∈Icc 1 n} (n-1)_{k-1}·n^{n-k} via global fiber sum over
    (periodic core P, induced single-cycle σ), fibers ≃ RootedForests P (banked Cayley machinery).
  * card_connectedMappings_eq_q: c_n = n^{n-1}·ramanujanQ n EXACTLY.
  * connectedProbability_isEquivalent: P(uniform random mapping on [n] connected) ~ √(π/(2n)) — the famous
    asymptotic, via Sharp.ramanujanQ_isEquivalent.
  Arc anatomy: Laplace-for-sums (Q) + generalized Cayley (forests) + periodic-core classification = a
  three-technique end-to-end result. (45th deliverable.)
- Expected cyclic points (codex, MAPCYC): CyclicPoints.lean (687L, namespace CyclicPointsNS). BANKED
  unconditional, 0 blocked: card_periodicAt (#{f : x₀ periodic} = Σ_k (n-1)_{k-1}·n^{n-k} via first-return
  fiber equivalence — same count as connected mappings, the classic curiosity), expected_cyclicPoints_eq_q
  (E[#cyclic] = ramanujanQ n EXACTLY, double-count + reused Q algebra), expected_cyclicPoints_isEquivalent
  (~ √(πn/2)). Third Q-tied random-mapping statistic. (46th deliverable.)
- Expected components of a random mapping (codex, MAPCOMP): MappingComponents.lean (456L, namespace
  MappingComponentsNS). BANKED: expected_components_eq — EXACT E[#components] = Σ_k (n)_k/(k·n^k) via
  candidate-cycle linearity (component ⟺ core cycle; #{f : f|_C = σ_C} = n^{n-k}); weighted-Ramanujan form
  Σ term_i/(i+1); sanity n=1→1, n=2→5/4 as theorems. PARTIAL honest: harmonic sandwich H(√n)/2 ≤ E ≤ H(n)
  (log order); sharp ~½log n flagged remaining (Gaussian-damped harmonic transfer). (47th deliverable.)
- SHARP components asymptotic (codex, MAPCOMP2): MappingComponentsSharp.lean (499L, namespace
  MappingComponentsNS.Sharp). BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked: expected_components_isEquivalent —
  E[#components] ~ (1/2)·log n (ratio→1), via L-windowed Gaussian-damped harmonic estimates. The
  random-mapping statistics suite is now SHARP across the board: P(connected)~√(π/2n), E[#cyclic]=Q(n)
  ~√(πn/2), E[#components]=Σ(n)_k/(k·n^k)~½log n — all exact + asymptotic, end-to-end. (48th deliverable.)
- LAGRANGE INVERSION campaign opened (codex, LAG — layer 1 banked): Ch1/Lagrange/ImplicitSeries.lean (218L).
  BANKED: implicitSeries φ (the unique T = X·φ(T), coefficient recursion, any CommRing), spec/uniqueness/
  constantCoeff/derivative identity; sanity φ=1+X (T = X/(1-X), coeffs 1). PARTIAL honest: the inversion
  formula n·[Xⁿ]T = [X^{n-1}]φⁿ NOT yet claimed — blocked precisely on formal residue infrastructure
  (res(F')=0 + change-of-variables res(H∘G·G')=res(H); the hard case res(G'/G)=1 reduces via G=X·u).
  LAG2 dispatched on exactly that plan (Stanley's residue proof). Famous Mathlib gap. (49th deliverable.)
- LAGRANGE INVERSION PROVED (codex, LAG2 — campaign prize, 2 bricks total): Ch1/Lagrange/Residue.lean (382L).
  BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked:
  * lagrange_inversion: (n:R)·[Xⁿ](implicitSeries φ) = [X^{n-1}](φⁿ) over any ℚ-algebra, φ with unit
    constant term (+ lagrange_inversion_divided). Stanley EC2 5.4.2 route.
  * Self-built mini formal-residue calculus (lightweight X^{-N}·F representation): res-of-derivative = 0,
    unit-kernel residues (res(G'/G)=1 core), change-of-variables residue_subst_unit — reusable framework.
  * Catalan sanity (φ=(1+X)²: coeff 1 = 1, coeff 2 = 2 ✓).
  A FAMOUS Mathlib gap closed. The book's tree-enumeration tool is now native to the repo. (50th deliverable.)
- Lagrange applications (codex, LAG3): Ch1/Lagrange/Applications.lean (119L). BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked:
  * coeff_implicitSeries_one_add_X_sq: T = X(1+T)² has coeff n = catalan n (Mathlib's catalan via
    n·catalan n = C(2n,n-1)); binary trees ↔ Catalan, from the new inversion.
  * coeff_implicitSeries_exp: T = X·e^T has coeff n = n^{n-1}/n! — CAYLEY VIA LAGRANGE, an independent
    algebraic second proof cross-validating the analytic TreeFunctionNS coefficients.
  (Nat.catalan is an export-alias of Mathlib's root catalan — same constant, no redefinition.) (51st.)
- PÓLYA ENUMERATION + NECKLACES (codex, PET): Ch1/Polya/Enumeration.lean (209L). BANKED unconditional,
  0 blocked on required layers:
  * card_fixedBy_colorings: {f // g•f = f} ≃ (orbits of ⟨g⟩ → C) ⟹ count = |C|^{#orbits} (the PET core).
  * polya_card_orbits_mul_card_group: #orbits(G on D→C)·|G| = Σ_g |C|^{#orbits⟨g⟩} (with Mathlib Burnside).
  * card_binary_necklaces: #binary necklaces(n)·n = Σ_{k∈ZMod n} 2^{gcd(n,k)} (orbit-of-rotation = gcd lemma).
  φ-form (Σ_{d|n}φ(d)2^{n/d}) honestly deferred. Famous gap (only Burnside was in Mathlib). (52nd deliverable.)
- Necklace φ-form (codex, PET2): Ch1/Polya/NecklacePhi.lean (124L). BANKED: card_binary_necklaces_phi_standard
  — #necklaces(n)·n = Σ_{d|n} φ(d)·2^{n/d} (the classical form), via the reusable gcd-fiber regrouping
  sum_zmod_by_gcd. Pólya/necklace cluster complete. (53rd deliverable.)
- WEIGHTED PÓLYA / cycle-index theorem (codex, PET3): Ch1/Polya/Weighted.lean (274L). BANKED unconditional,
  0 blocked: sum_weight_fixedBy (fixed-coloring weight sum = ∏_{cycles σ} Σ_c w(c)^{|σ|}), weighted_burnside,
  weighted_polya (|G|·Σ_O W(O) = Σ_g ∏_σ Σ_c w^{|σ|} — THE Pólya theorem), w≡1 sanity recovers unweighted.
  Pólya framework now complete (Burnside→unweighted→necklaces gcd+φ→weighted/cycle-index). (54th deliverable.)
- BRACELETS (codex, BRACE): Ch1/Polya/Bracelets.lean (589L). BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked, ALL n>0:

  (n/2)·2^{n/2}). Full dihedral machinery: MulAction of DihedralGroup n on ZMod n (Mathlib convention
  r i ↦ x-i documented), reflection fixed-points (1 / parity-split 2,0), reflection orbits ((n+1)/2 etc.),
  rotation orbits = gcd. The Pólya cluster now covers necklaces AND bracelets. (55th deliverable.)
- BELL NUMBERS + mean blocks (codex, BELL): Ch2/SetPartitions/BellMean.lean (677L). BANKED unconditional,
  0 blocked, all 4 layers: bellNumber n := card (Finpartition univ(Fin n)) (genuine; Mathlib lacked it),
  sanity 1/1/2/5, the Bell recurrence (root-block fiber), Σ_P #blocks = B_{n+1}−B_n (+ addition form),
  E[#blocks] = B_{n+1}/B_n − 1 over ℚ. First exact probe of the Bell block-CLT frontier. (56th deliverable.)
- Bell second moment + variance (codex, BELL2): Ch2/SetPartitions/BellVariance.lean (700L). BANKED
  unconditional, 0 blocked: sum_parts_succ (weighted add-element fiber), bellNumber_add_two_eq
  (B_{n+2} = Σ#p² + 2Σ#p + 2B_n), variance_blocks_eq (exact rational variance in Bell ratios). The exact
  moment layer of the Bell block-count frontier is complete (mean + variance). (57th deliverable.)
- Three-front state: FCF (Flajolet CF) + PARTA (partition upper bound, campaign opener per ChatGPT R1
  route, archived HANDOFF/partition-campaign-route-R1.md) still grinding.
- Flajolet CF, algebra layer (codex, FCF): Ch5/ContinuedFractions/Flajolet.lean (456L). BANKED honestly:
  flajolet_cf — the first-return recursion unfolds to the finite J-fraction (full induction, base h=0,
  h=1 specialization, sanity coeffs 1/c₀/c₀²+a₀b₀). HONEST CAVEAT banked in Audit comment: W is the
  recursive-coefficient series; the WpathSum = Wcoeff bridge (literal Finset path-sum) is NOT yet proved —
  FCF2 dispatched on exactly that gap (transport noise through the recursive path type was the blocker).
  Genuine path model (MotzkinPath/pathWeight/WpathSum) is in the file. (58th deliverable, fidelity-labeled.)
- PARTITION CAMPAIGN Milestone A (codex, PARTA): Ch8/Partitions/UpperBound.lean (466L). BANKED
  unconditional, 0 blocked: partition_log_upper (log p(n) ≤ 2√(An), n>0) + partition_upper_exp
  (p(n) ≤ e^{π√(2n/3)}, all n) for the GENUINE part n = card (Nat.Partition n). Elementary GF route per
  the ChatGPT-R1 map. Milestones B (Laplace t·log P(e^{-t})→π²/6), C (log-Tauberian), D (transfer) queued.
  (59th deliverable.)
- FLAJOLET CF THEOREM COMPLETE (codex, FCF2): FlajoletPathSum.lean (154L). BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked:
  WpathSum_eq_Wcoeff (the path-sum bridge — constructor-split induction beat the transport noise) +
  coeff_JFraction_eq_pathSum (J-fraction coefficients = LITERAL weighted Motzkin path sums). The famous
  Flajolet 1980 theorem is now fully combinatorial end-to-end; the fidelity caveat from FCF is discharged
  and the Audit comment upgraded. (60th deliverable.)
- Partition Milestone B PARTIAL (codex, PARTB): LaplaceAsymptotic.lean (221L). BANKED honestly:
  partLaplace_summable + partition_laplace_series_asymptotic (the Euler log-series limit → π²/6 — the
  analytic half: termwise + domination + ℕ+ Basel). BLOCKED precisely: the real Euler product bridge
  PartLaplace = ∏'(1−e^{−tk})⁻¹. PARTB2 dispatched on the K-sandwich route (finite product = sum over
  partitions with parts ≤ K — finite combinatorics; monotone limits both sides). (61st deliverable, partial.)
- Partition Euler product bridge (codex, PARTB2): EulerProduct.lean (442L). BANKED unconditional:
  boundedPartitionEquivCounts (genuine bounded-partition↔multiplicity), finite_euler_prod_eq
  (∏_{k≤K}(1−x^k)⁻¹ = Σ' partsLE K·xⁿ via ENNReal regrouping), partLaplace_eq_finprod_tendsto (K-sandwich:

  BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked: log_partLaplace_eq, log_series_regroup, and THE LAPLACE ASYMPTOTIC
  partition_laplace_log_asymptotic — t·log P(e^{−t}) → π²/6 for the genuine partition counts. Milestone C
  (log-Tauberian, the central reusable asset) dispatched next. (63rd deliverable.)

  sqrt_laplace_bad_inside_gap, sqrt_laplace_full_gap (B<2√K), log_Cum_le_laplace (limsup core) + the
  exp(B√N−tN) summability/bound toolbox. BLOCKED precisely: the STRONG restricted gap (B=2√K+η off-window)
  → localization → liminf → full theorem. PARTC2 dispatched with the unimodal-boundary decomposition
  (g(cK/t²)=(K/t)(B′√c−c); 2√c−c=1−(√c−1)²<1; lower tail poly×gap; upper tail linear-decay geometric).
  (64th deliverable, partial.)
- Tauberian STRONG GAP (codex, PARTC2): TauberianFull.lean (892L). BANKED unconditional:
  sqrt_laplace_restricted_gap_strong — the route-critical estimate (B=2√K+η off-window ≤ e^{(K−ρ)/t}),
  via the prescribed unimodal-boundary decomposition (boundary algebra 2√c−c=1−(√c−1)², concavity-of-√
  tail decay, poly/geom absorption) + 9 supporting lemmas. Remaining: assembly layers (global eventual
  Cum bound, Abel localization, limsup, liminf diagonal, full theorem) → PARTC3. (65th deliverable.)
- THE LOG-TAUBERIAN THEOREM COMPLETE (codex, PARTC3 — Milestone C done): TauberianAssembly.lean (634L).
  BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked, all four layers: tauberian_cum_limsup, tauberian_cum_global_bound,
  tauberian_exists_large_cum_near_saddle (Abel localization), tauberian_cum_eventual_lower +
  log_tauberian_cumulative_sqrt (t·logF→K ⟹ logCum/√N → 2√K). The campaign's central reusable asset.
  Milestone D (monotone transfer → log p(n) ~ π√(2n/3)) dispatched. (66th deliverable.)
- ★ PARTITION CAMPAIGN COMPLETE (codex, PARTD — finale): LogAsymptotic.lean (242L). BANKED unconditional,
  0 blocked: part_mono, partition_cum_log_asymptotic, two_sqrt_A_const_eq, and THE PRIZE —
  partition_log_asymptotic (log p(n)/√n → π√(2/3)) + partition_log_isEquivalent (log p(n) ~ π√(2n/3)),
  for the genuine card (Nat.Partition n). THE HARDY–RAMANUJAN LOG-ASYMPTOTIC — the long-flagged hard
  frontier — formalized fully elementarily in ONE day: ChatGPT-R1 route (Tauberian, no circle method) +
  7 codex bricks (A, B×3, C×3, D), every layer audited clean-3. The log-Tauberian is a permanent reusable
  asset. (67th deliverable.) Remaining true frontier: the sharp HR constant e^{π√(2n/3)}/(4n√3) (circle method).
- DISTINCT-PARTS asymptotic (codex, DISTINCT): DistinctParts.lean (848L). BANKED unconditional, 0 blocked:
  distinct_log_asymptotic (log q(n)/√n → π√(1/3)) + IsEquivalent (log q(n) ~ π√(n/3)) — Erdős, for the
  genuine Nodup-partition count. Full pipeline reuse: the log(1+y)=log(1−y²)−log(1−y) reduction (K = π²/12
  from the banked limits at t,2t), the SAME log-Tauberian, largest-part monotonicity. First reuse of the
  central asset — one brick. (68th deliverable.)
- ODD-PARTS asymptotic (Opus): OddParts.lean. BANKED: opart_eq_qpart (Euler's partition theorem transported,
  via Mathlib card_odds_eq_card_distincts) + odd_log_asymptotic (log o(n)/√n → π√(1/3)) for the genuine

  glaisher_log_asymptotic — ∀m≥2, log r_m(n)/√n → π√(2(1−1/m)/3) for the genuine no-part-divisible-by-m
  count (Euler split to banked limits at t,mt; the same Tauberian; add-a-1 monotonicity); m=2 cross-check
  rpart_two_eq_opart. An infinite canonical family in one theorem — the pipeline's second reuse. (70th.)
- GENERAL COMPOSITIONS family, PARTIAL (codex, COMPGEN): CompositionsGeneral.lean (546L). BANKED:
  partPoly_rhoS (unique positive root ρ_S ∈ (0,1)) and THE PERRON-STYLE DOMINANCE root_eq_rhoS_of_gcd
  (gcd(S)=1 ⟹ any root with |z|≤ρ_S equals ρ_S — same-ray triangle equality + gcd phase argument; the

  unconditional, 0 blocked: Close.compS_isEquivalent — ∀ finite S (|S|≥2, 0∉S, gcd=1), the genuine ordered

  deriv>0, dominant annulus from the Perron theorem, assembly via banked SupercriticalSeqGenuine.
  A family theorem covering every finite alphabet — generalizes the Fibonacci instance. (72nd deliverable.)

  n·p(n) = Σ σ₁(m)·p(n−m) (part-occurrence double count, add-k-copies bijection, genuine
  ArithmeticFunction.sigma). Summatory estimate honestly deferred (precise plan reported) → PARTE2.

  sigma_summatory_asymptotic — Σ_{m≤x}σ₁(m) = π²x²/12 + O(x log x), explicit K = 8+π² (hyperbola +
  Basel tail + harmonic + floor lift). (74th deliverable.) Next: Stage I.3 kernel package (erdosWeight
  total mass / tail tightness / window limit).
- HR Stage I.3 layer 1 (codex, PARTE3): ErdosKernel.lean (278L). BANKED: u_recurrence (the normalized
  Erdős recurrence) + boundaryTerm_negligible + supports (C²=4A, σ ≤ n², summatory quadratic bound).
  BLOCKED precisely: tail/window/total need (i) the ⌊m/√n⌋ block-decomposition reindex lemma and (ii) Abel
  summation against the σ-summatory with uniform window replacements — PARTE4 dispatched. (75th, partial.)
- HR Stage I.3 tail (codex, PARTE4): ErdosKernelClose.lean (767L). BANKED: erdos_kernel_tail (∀ε∃R kernel
  mass beyond R√n eventually ≤ ε; block decomposition + quadratic summatory + exponential kill) + the
  block-reindex infra. BLOCKED precisely: window limit needs the sub-block summatory difference
  S(β√n)−S(α√n) = (π²/12)n(β²−α²)+O(√n log n) + uniform replacements + the closed-form improper integral
  — PARTE5 dispatched. (76th deliverable, partial-arc.)
- CODEX WEEKLY QUOTA EXHAUSTED until Jun 10 7:27 PM — genuine engine hard-block, reported to Xiang with
  options (Opus-solo + ChatGPT-draft loop / wait / credits). PARTE5 never ran. Continuing solo.
- HR Stage I.3 infra (Opus, during outage): SummatoryWindow.lean. BANKED: summatory_window_diff —
  S(β√n)−S(α√n) = (π²/12)n(β²−α²) + O((α+β)√n log(2β√n)), explicit K, clean first-compile. The estimate
  the kernel window limit consumes. (77th deliverable; Opus-solo.)

  (∫₀^∞ t·e^{−rt} = 1/r², via Mathlib scaled Gamma) + kernel_density_integral_one ((π²/6)∫₀^∞ ye^{−(C/2)y}
  = 1, the C²=4A normalization). Two pieces of PARTE5 now banked solo (window-diff + integral); remaining:
  the uniform replacements + sub-block Riemann assembly. (78th deliverable; Opus-solo.)
- HR Stage I.3 infra (Opus, during outage): ErdosUniform.lean. BANKED: sqrt_diff_eq (exact
  rationalization), sqrt_diff_window_approx (|·−m/(2√n)| ≤ b²/(2√n)), inv_window_approx
  (|1/(n−m)−1/n| ≤ 2b/n^{3/2}) — the uniform erdosWeight→model-kernel conversion estimates.
  PARTE5 solo progress: 3 of ~5 pieces banked (window-diff, integral, replacements); remaining:
  the sub-block Riemann assembly + the window/total theorems. (79th deliverable; Opus-solo.)
- HR Stage I.3 window-mass limit (ChatGPT-draft + Opus-fix loop, 11 rounds): ErdosModel.lean (391L).
  BANKED: halfOpenMass_tendsto — (S(β√n)−S(α√n))/n → (π²/12)(β²−α²) ∀ 0≤α<β (the substantive window-mass
  limit, with the α=0 case), summatory_zero_to_beta_scaled_tendsto, model_exp_endpoint_squeeze. The draft's
  weighted-block squeeze hand-waved the summatory↔windowed-sum INDEX BRIDGE — truncated honestly; the
  bridge is the next brick. Draft-loop lessons: hλ identifier breaks the parser; squeeze_zero_norm' needs
  explicit (a := ·); div_le_div→div_le_div₀. (80th deliverable.)
- HR Stage I.3 INDEX BRIDGE (Opus): SummatoryBridge.lean. BANKED: window_filter_eq_Ioc +
  summatory_diff_eq_window_sum — S(β√n)−S(α√n) = Σ_{Icc 1 (n−1)} if-window σ(m) (the floor/filter/
  Ioc-telescope identity the ChatGPT draft hand-waved). The half-open masses now connect to the
  model-kernel windowed sums. Remaining Stage I.3: weighted block squeeze (rehabilitate from the draft
  with this bridge) → step assembly → window/total. (81st deliverable; Opus-solo.)
- HR Stage I.3 BLOCK SQUEEZE (Opus): BlockSqueeze.lean. BANKED: floor_beta_sqrt_le_eventually +
  weighted_window_block_squeeze — the rehabilitated squeeze (both sides on Icc 1 (n−1) via the index
  bridge; termwise endpoint exponentials; compiled essentially first-try). Stage I.3 toolkit now complete:
  the step assembly (δ-mesh over [a,b] + the squeeze + halfOpenMass_tendsto ⟹ erdos_kernel_window) is the
  remaining piece, then total mass. (82nd deliverable; Opus-solo.)
- HR Stage I.3 STEP ASSEMBLY (R4 ChatGPT-draft + Opus): ModelAssembly.lean (mesh defs, blockSum_add,
  arith partition, lowerSeq/upperSeq tendsto, blockSum_eventually_between_mesh_eps) + MeshEstimate.lean
  (Opus: the R4 draft's LONE AXIOM mesh_endpoint_sums_approx_integral PROVED — per-block sandwich by exp
  monotonicity + Lipschitz gap C·Q·b·(b−a)·h — and model_kernel_window assembled: blockSum → modelIntegral).
  Q/halfOpenMass de-privatized in ErdosModel for cross-file use. STATUS: written, NOT yet verified —
  uisai1 tailscale outage mid-verify; uisai2 bootstrap (clone+cache) in progress as fallback. KernelTotal.lean
  (erdos_kernel_total ε-assembly: window+tail+∫₀^∞=1) drafted ahead; depends on R5 erdos_kernel_window
  (ChatGPT draft c8b26c17 in flight). No banking claims until lake-verified.
- HR Stage I.3 KERNEL PACKAGE CLOSED (mixed ChatGPT-draft/Opus): VERIFIED per-file on uisai2
  (uisai1 tailscale outage mid-campaign; uisai2 bootstrapped from GitHub + mathlib cache as fallback
  build host). ModelAssembly (mesh partition/squeeze assembly) + MeshEstimate (the R4 draft's lone
  axiom mesh_endpoint_sums_approx_integral PROVED — per-block exp-monotone sandwich + Lipschitz gap
  C·Q·b·(b−a)·h — and model_kernel_window assembled) + KernelWindow (erdos_kernel_window: true-kernel
  window limit, Opus solo while R5 capture was down; per-term σ(m)·(2b+Cb²/2)/n^{3/2} + quadratic mass)
  + KernelTotal (erdos_kernel_total → 1: window+tail sandwich + ∫₀^∞=1 via ExpDecay integrability)
  + PartMono (p(n) ≤ p(n+1), Stage I.5 prerequisite). API lessons: ∑ in removed; le_or_lt→le_or_gt;
  abs_add→abs_add_le; private defs invisible cross-file (de-privatized Q/halfOpenMass/meshPoint_*);
  fun_prop fails on mvar integrands (name the continuity have); field_simp often closes fully (no
  trailing ring); filter lambdas need explicit (m : ℕ); no Mathlib integrability companion for
  rpow·exp — use integrable_of_isBigO_exp_neg. (83rd–87th deliverables.)
- HR Stage I.5/I.6 OPENING BRICKS (Opus): LocalLower.lean (u_local_lower_from_monotone — forward
  propagation from part_mono; R6 lemma 14) + KernelBarriers.lean (kernelMass/kernelWindow/barrier/slack
  defs; erdos_kernel_fixed_window_pos via window(1,2] limit + integral positivity; barrier range bounds;
  boundaryTerm ≤ δ·slack via n⁵e^{−C√n}→0). R6 route audited: barrier package (A–C) accepted; renewal
  lemma 20 REFUTED (v j = sin√j counterexample — o(1) residual too weak); R7 challenge dispatched for
  corrected statement / percolation route. (88th–89th deliverables.)
- HR Stage I.5 BARRIER GAP (Opus): BarrierGap.lean — upperBarrier_gap_on_window +
  lowerBarrier_gap_on_window (R6 lemma 4), one core estimate A/log(n−m+E) − A/log(n+E) ≥
  (A·a₀/2)·slack via log r ≤ r−1; gcongr auto-discharges monotone div steps from context.
  (90th deliverable.)
- HR Stage I.5 STRUCTURE CLOSED CONDITIONALLY (Opus): BarrierHarmonic.lean (super/subharmonic
  of the log barriers, conditional on the o(slack) mass rate as explicit hypothesis; A=1 suffices
  after fixing my own scaling bug — lower side needs ρ < a₀μ/2, so the ∀ρ form is the right
  hypothesis) + BarrierInduction.lean (u_pos, u_upper_of_superharmonic via strong induction with
  sup' base segment, u_limsup_finite_of_superharmonic, u_lower_of_subharmonic via inf' base,
  u_liminf_positive_of_subharmonic). Stage I.5 now reduces FORMALLY to one brick:
  erdos_kernel_total_log_rate (the second-order cancellation). (91st–92nd deliverables.)
- HR Stage I.6 RECORD BASICS (Opus): RecordBasics.lean — records + finite-interval existence
  (strengthened to interval-wide extremality after the k ≤ H coverage bug), the convergence
  assembly u_tendsto_of_record_covers (threshold-monotone covers ⟹ Cauchy via record extrema
  on [N₀, max p q]), limit positivity, and u_local_high_forward_fill (monotone fill, h = 2ε/(CM)).
  Kernel-free layers of the R7 record route. (93rd deliverable.)
- HR MASS-RATE opening (Opus, R8 route): MassRateMoments.lean — sigmaMoment defs, massLam = C/2
  (λ² = π²/6), Bose kernel + regularization + exp-form, and mass_rate_sqrt_coeff_cancel (the central
  cancellation, hand-verified before formalizing). R8 archived: Lambert-moment route replaces
  pointwise summatory (impossible at integers — σ(n) jumps). (94th deliverable.)
- MASS-RATE kernel side COMPLETE + LAMBERT (Opus): MassRateExpansion (§3.2–3.4; sqrt-drop second
  order via 8s³E=(s−q)³(q+3s) linear_combination — no calculus), MassRateTail (§4.1 explicit
  n³e^{−(C/2)n^{1/6}}), MassRateCoef (§3.5 combined coefficient, exact cross term −Cm³/(8s⁷)),
  MassRateLambert (§2.1: M₀ = Σ boseKernel(tk) via Mathlib divisors-antidiagonal machinery —
  TsumDivisorsAntidiagonal found by survey, brick shrank 300→100 lines). Precision-budget recheck:
  EM brick needs only O(1) Riemann-sum error (no −1/12 limit, no trapezoid term); R10 dispatched
  with the budget analysis + the variance-cancellation trap in the g−h split. (95th–98th deliverables.)
- MASS-RATE Geom2 (Opus): tsum d²y^d = y(1+y)/(1−y)³ (n² = 2C(n+2,2)−3C(n+1,1)+C(n,0) over
  choose-geometric). M₁ design: secondary integral reduces to the M₀ FTC core via the boundary
  cancellation −z·boseKernel + 1/z → 0 at 0+ (logged in R8 HANDOFF). R11 (M₁ rearrangement draft)
  queued behind R10. (99th deliverable.)
- MASS-RATE boseReg0 ANALYSIS CORE COMPLETE (Opus, R10 bricks 1–18): ExpBounds (#100, first-try),
  Bose bounds (#101), Antideriv+FTC+limits (#102), THE INTEGRAL ∫boseReg0 = −1/2 (#103, FTC anchor),
  Deriv closed form + tail (#104), DerivZero (#105, hand-computed degree-6 certificate, first-try
  ring verification), DerivInt in final verify. R12 (Riemann O(1) general lemma, full proof plan
  attached) dispatched; R11 (M₁ rearrangement) v1 extracted. (100th–105th deliverables.)
- MASS-RATE M₁ LAMBERT BANKED (Opus, 7 fix rounds): sigmaMoment_one_lambert + boseKernel_hasDerivAt
  (#109), cubic geometric sum (#107), Basel split (#108). Root cause of rounds 4–6: Lean calc step
  grammar is `term := proof` — a trailing calc swallows following `have h : T := ...` / `set x := ...`
  tactics as further steps (probe-bisect diagnosis: truncate + read unsolved-goals context cutoff).
  All six trailing calcs rewritten as have-chains + le_trans. Lesson banked to memory.
  M₂ (boseKernel3 mirror) + sigmaMoment_le_power (crude (r+2)!·2^{r+3}/t^{r+3} bound, descFactorial
  route) written, in fix rounds. R12 bridge capture failed 4× — manual paste requested. (106th–108th
  deliverables.)

## Run 2026-06-14 00:55 (overnight, Xiang asleep)
- doctrine: refreshed for 2026-06-14 frontier (whole-book audited FAITHFUL; 2 scope notes remain)
- approval: terminal `/automode` + "我要睡了, 交给你了" (standing /goal, no gate)
- starting avenue: (a) close audit loop [async] ‖ (b) Ch2 CYC closed form
- end: <fill on close>
- final result: <fill on close>

### 2026-06-14 progress (overnight)
- (a) whole-book audit CLOSED: 6 independent Opus auditors (Ch1/2/3/5/8-Saddle/8-Part)
  + ChatGPT ac/ac2 faithfulness — ALL FAITHFUL/CLEAN. erdos clean-3 already at 95b4a77.
  Summary: HANDOFF/AUDIT-WHOLEBOOK.md. Fixed stale u-docstring in CeilingEscapeClose.
- (b) CLOSED clean-3: Ch2/EGF/LabelledCycExp.lean — exp_egf_lcyc (exp(CYC(C))=SEQ(C),
  = CYC=log(1/(1-C))) + egf_lseq_deriv. Resolves CYC closed-form scope note.
- (c) CLOSED clean-3: Ch5/ContinuedFractions/FlajoletUnbounded.lean —
  coeff_JFraction_height_indep + Wcoeff_height_indep (height-bound immaterial per coeff).
  Resolves flajolet_cf height-bound scope note. (step-list↔code bijection still separate.)
- (d) HR constant: route identified (HANDOFF/HR-CONSTANT-ROUTE.md). NOT extractable from
  renewal/mass-rate (homogeneity); comparison route via 2nd-order Laplace prefactor →
  a=1/(4√3). Brick 2 (partLaplace_second_order) is the hard core. GRINDING.

### 2026-06-14 (d) progress — File1 done
- (d) brick2 File1 `LogOneMinusExp.lean` COMMITTED green (ad444c6, 0 sorry, Mathlib-only):
  log1mexp/log1mexpReg defs + log1mexpReg_eq + log1mexp_nonneg + log1mexp_tail_bound
  (|f|≤2e^{-x}) + log1mexpReg_tendsto_zero (singularity removed). Foundation done.
- FRONTIER (the deep core): File2 TrapezoidEM.lean — one-off Euler–Maclaurin/trapezoid
  lemma with C² error (per-cell C·t³ → o(1)). Needs log1mexp deriv2 bounds
  (f'=-1/(e^x-1), f''=e^x/(e^x-1)²; h'' bounded on [0,2] via removable singularity).
  ChatGPT R3 dispatched for the full Lean proof of trapezoid_sum_head (no effort cap).
  Then File3 (Stirling assembly) + bricks 3,4,5 (Abelian comparison, modelSaddle, algebra).
  (d) is a deep multi-file analysis subproject (Meinardus 2nd-order); File1 foundation in.

### 2026-06-14 (d) File2 done
- (d) brick2 File2 `TrapezoidEM.lean` COMMITTED green (c1bdac1, 0 sorry): the generic
  Euler-Maclaurin summation core (trapezoid_sum_identity_range +
  trapezoid_head_(range_)tendsto_of_cell_bound). Structural core of singular-EM route DONE.
  Bug fought: integral-notation precedence (∫…,g x - … absorbs trailing term → parenthesize).
- FRONTIER: per-cell bound cell_trapezoid_bound_of_deriv_lipschitz (R4 dispatched);
  log1mexpReg deriv2-on-[0,2] (removable singularity h''=e^x/(e^x-1)²-1/x²→1/12); tail
  trapezoid; File3 ProductSecondOrder (Stirling head assembly → partLaplace_second_order);
  bricks 3-5 (Abelian comparison, modelSaddle real saddle, algebra → a=1/(4√3)).

### 2026-06-14 (d) File3 done — generic EM head machinery COMPLETE
- (d) brick2 File3 TrapezoidCell COMMITTED green (bec6da1, 0 sorry):
  cell_trapezoid_bound_of_lipschitz_deriv (per-cell |trap-int|≤M h² from M-Lipschitz deriv,
  chord interpolation). File1+File2+File3 = the REUSABLE generic Euler–Maclaurin head
  machinery, fully proved.
- FRONTIER (analytic crux): apply to g=log1mexpReg. gp=log1mexpReg'=-1/(e^x-1)+1/x has a
  REMOVABLE singularity at 0 (gp(0)=1/2, gp'(0)=1/12). Head sum starts k=1 so args kt≥t>0 —
  likely apply cell lemma on [t,2] avoiding 0. Need: gp Lipschitz with uniform M on (0,2],
  HasDerivAt + integrability. R5 dispatched. Then tail trapezoid + Stirling head assembly
  (∑-log(tk)=-N log t-log N!, Stirling→2π) → partLaplace_second_order; then bricks 3-5.

### 2026-06-14 (d) brick2 analytic core COMPLETE (6 files)
- TrapezoidCellIoc (9391734): open-left per-cell producer (cells a>0, deriv on Ioc 0 2).
- LogRegLipschitz (231e7dd): log1mexpReg'=Erdos.boseAntideriv, 5-Lipschitz on (0,2]
  (REUSES repo boseReg0 bounds — removable-singularity crux dissolved, no new analysis).
- LogRegCell (c1a529b): log1mexpReg_cell_trapezoid_bound_pos (|trap-int|≤5h² per cell).
- (d) brick2 conceptual core DONE: generic EM machinery (File1/2/3) + log1mexpReg cells
  bounded. All 6 files green/0-sorry/pushed.
- REMAINING brick2 assembly: (i) head-peel summation trapezoid_head_..._pos (File2 head
  variant peeling first cell [0,t] via log1mexpReg_tendsto_zero + a first-cell lemma);
  (ii) tail trapezoid (exp tail on [R,∞)); (iii) Stirling head ∑-log(tk)=-N log t-log N!
  → 2π via Stirling.log_stirlingSeq_formula; (iv) assemble + identify I=A via
  partition_laplace_log_asymptotic → partLaplace_second_order.
  Then bricks 3 (Abelian comparison), 4 (modelSaddle real saddle), 5 (algebra → 1/(4√3)).

### 2026-06-14 (d) brick2 head asymptotic DONE (7 files)
- TrapezoidCellIoc, LogRegLipschitz, LogRegCell, TrapezoidHeadPos all green/0-sorry/pushed.
- log1mexpReg head trapezoid asymptotic proven (cond. on [0,b] integrability).
- REMAINING brick2: (1) [0,b] integrability discharge (ContinuousOn Icc 0 b via right-limit=0);
  (2) Stirling head Σ-log(tk)=-N log t-log N! → 2π via Stirling (THE prefactor source);
  (3) assemble head → log_partLaplace head with (1/2)log(t/2π); (4) tail trapezoid (deriv-decay).
  R7 dispatched for (1)(2)(3). Then partLaplace_second_order; bricks 3-5.

### 2026-06-14 (d) brick2 — 2π EXTRACTED (9 files)
- LogRegIntegrable (118d29d): log1mexpReg ContinuousOn[0,2]+integrable (head hint discharge).
- StirlingHead (f0ef242): singularHead_stirling — Σ-log(tk)-[(R-R log R)/t+½log(t/2π)]→0.
  THE 2π source, from Mathlib Stirling.log_stirlingSeq_formula+tendsto_stirlingSeq_sqrt_pi.
  9 brick-2 files all green/0-sorry. The 2π prefactor of √(t/2π) is now formalized.
- REMAINING brick2: head assembly log1mexp_head_asymp (combine StirlingHead singular +
  TrapezoidHeadPos regularized via log1mexp=log1mexpReg-log, ∫_0^R log x=R log R-R) →
  Σlog1mexp(kt)-(1/t)∫_0^R log1mexp-½log(t/2π)-½log1mexpReg(R)→0; then tail; then
  log_partLaplace_second_order (identify I=A via first-order). Then bricks 3-5 → a=1/(4√3).

### 2026-06-14 (d) brick2 HEAD COMPLETE (10 files)
- LogHeadAssembly (head asymptotic w/ 2π): log1mexp_head_asymp green. Head side of brick2 done.
- REMAINING: tail trapezoid (Σ_{k>N} log1mexp(kt) - tail integral + ½f(R)→0; needs exp-decay
  deriv producer per R6) + final assembly (head+tail → log P - I/t - ½log(t/2π)→0, identify
  I=A via partition_laplace_log_asymptotic) → partLaplace_second_order. Then bricks 3-5.

### 2026-06-14 (d) brick2 tail — foundation drafted, consolidation
- Tail helpers (R8 plan, HANDOFF/HR-tail-R8.md) drafted; ~6 API mismatches remain
  (tsum_congr not ext, manual AEStronglyMeasurable, field_simp/ring tweaks). Draft preserved
  at HANDOFF/LogOneMinusExpTail-WIP.lean.txt. NOT committed to source (main stays green).
- (d) STATE: brick2 HEAD COMPLETE (10 green files, 2π extracted + head asymptotic assembled).
  REMAINING (all specified in HANDOFF/HR-tail-R8.md + HR-CONSTANT-ROUTE.md):
  brick2 tail (helpers API-fix + local cell-bound refactor of TrapezoidCellIoc +
  tail_trapezoid_bound_of_exp_cell_errors HasSum theorem); head+tail → partLaplace_second_order
  (via log_partLaplace_eq + log_series_regroup, identify I=A); bricks 3-5 (Abelian comparison,
  modelSaddle real saddle, algebra → a=1/(4√3)).

### 2026-06-14 (d) brick2 tail — set machinery done, summation theorem WIP
- TailCell (local cell bound, fills R8 sorry) + TailLip (log1mexp per-cell ≤4e^{-a}h²) COMMITTED green.
- TailSum: tailCell/tailTrapErr defs + pairwise_disjoint_tailCell + iUnion_tailCell_eq_Ioi all
  COMPILE; tail_trapezoid_bound_of_exp_cell_errors (HasSum, R8-flagged iteration-prone) ~90% —
  2 remaining structural issues: (1) hpartial line ~146: B = ∫ tailCell (SET integral over Ioc) vs
  tailTrapErr's INTERVAL integral ∫ a..b — need intervalIntegral.integral_of_le bridge inside the
  Finset.sum; (2) hright_lim line ~210: Tendsto .sub/.add limit-chaining elaboration. WIP preserved
  at HANDOFF/TailSum-WIP.lean.txt. main GREEN at 13 brick-2 files.
- (d) STATE: brick2 head 100% (2π extracted+assembled); brick2 tail ~90% (foundation+cells+set
  machinery green; summation theorem WIP w/ 2 documented issues). REMAINING: close TailSum HasSum
  (B bridge + .sub) → final tail theorem → head+tail → partLaplace_second_order → bricks 3-5.
